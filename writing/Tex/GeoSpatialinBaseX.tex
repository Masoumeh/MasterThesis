\subsection{Motivation}
BaseX~\cite{www/basex} is a high-performance XML~\cite{www/xml}
 database which is developed in Konstanz university.
It has a powerful text processor as well as the full support 
for XQuery~\cite{www/xquery,www/xqueryfun} language according to \cite{conf/xsym/GrunGHS09}.
Our goal is to empower BaseX to process the geospatial data in an efficient way. This means to add the support of handling \emph{Geography Markup Language (GML)} data. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)
which is an internationally recognized organization for geospatial standards,
is defined this new special XML grammar for the geographical data.
We want to have a complete support of this language in BaseX
which means the abilities to read, to write, and to query on this data.
To achieve this goal we need extensive knowledge over existing researches on the geospatial data and specifically indexing techniques. In this work, a short survay is .....

\subsection{Overview}
This essay will first define the concepts needed later in the discussion, called
Methodology, in Section~\ref{s.method}. In this section, the basic geospatial data
and it's application areas will be introduced. Also, various ways that other works
are processing this data will be investigated in Section~\ref{s.rwork}. BaseX,
as a native XML database, which is our focus in this essay, is studied and extended
by a module to handle geospatial data in Section~\ref{s.basex}. 
Section~\ref{s.mongo} improves the efficiency of the module
by proposing another novel way considering MongoDB.
Finally, new ideas for further works are explained in
Section~\ref{s.future}.

\section{Geospatial Data Processing}
\label{s.method}
%TODO:in tarifa bere bakhshe badi, inja chanta jomle koli begam
According to \emph{Collins} dictionary, \emph{Geospatial} is an adjective relating to a position of things on the Earth's surface, also \emph{Geospatial Data} is the data representing any thing on the Earth's surface. Regarding the importance of the geospatial data, many standards and systems have been developed  during the years to represent and make use of this data. Different countries and organizations are using different systems and standards to represent this data and consequently there are numerous systems to fulfill a range of target requirements. The World Geodesic System (WGS) is one of the standard geospatial systems that is commonly used all around the world. WGS84 is the latest version of this standard which
was introduced in $1984$ and is widely used for expressing the locations on Earth in wide range of services, including satellite services, notably Global Positioning System (GPS), and Google Maps which employ this system as a reference.

In this section, we go through the existing concepts and technologies about the geospatial data processing. After some basic definitions in Section \ref{termsanddef}, the process of this data in the native databases are investigated in Section \ref{s.geo-data-in-xml-data}.
Finally, the geospatial indexing and a set of related algorithms are introduced in Section \ref{s.geospatial-index}.

\subsection{Terms and Definitions}
\label{termsanddef}
As defined before, Geospatial data is the locational information describing \textit{features} and locations and their characteristics which have a spatial component to connect them to a place on the Earth, such as countries, cities, buildings, roads, and rivers. Here, a \textit{feature} represents a physical entity, e.g. a structure, a lake, a tree, or a shape. In fact, it is an abstraction of the phenomenon in the real world, such as geometries, attributes, and relationships. Hence, real-world entities could be expressed as a set of features.
Geospatial data also applies to the three-dimensional data, like above and below the Earth's surface (see~\cite{powell}). Quiet often, this information is described in the multi-layer hierarchy. Geospatial objects and entities are formulated through encodings and formats developed in regards to the specific requirements. An ordered set of numbers, called coordinates, identifies the position of objects which are defined in a coordinate system. 
%Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)~\cite{ogc} is an international consortium, developing interface standards for geospatial content, services, data exchange, data communication, and data processing. Geospatial data is given usually by its position its coordinate.

A \emph{coordinate system} as a basic concept is a method to uniquely determine the position of an object in a space of a given dimension. It uses the definitions, components, and properties to determine the coordinates which specify the linear and angular positions. Coordinate systems are defined by various organization, countries, or governments based on the geodetic data, units, projections, and some other parameters. For example, WGS coordinate system is defined to visualize the geographic data on a map or on the Earth. 

A country may have more than one coordinate system for its national-wide geographic data. As an instance, all three systems \textit{DHDN}\footnote{Deutsches Hauptdreiecksnetz}, \textit{ETRS89 UTM zone 32N}, and \textit{PD/83 Zone 3} are examples of Germany's coordinate systems. These are considered as local ones while there are the world coordinate system for the coordinates in the world space, like WGS system. The coordinates may differ for the same object from a system to another. As an example, the coordinates of Berlin in WGS84 coordinate system with longitude and latitude is $(52.520007, 13.404954)$ while in Germany's \textit{ETRS89 UTM zone 32N} coordinate system is $(32798809.64, 5828000.49)$. Accordingly, it is necessary to know how the coordinate systems are related in concepts and definitions to make the conversion possible. 
In geographic information systems (GIS), coordinate systems are categorized in two major and common types:

\begin{itemize}
\item Global or spherical coordinate system: Also referred as \textit{geographic coordinate system}, represents the data on the Earth in a 3D spherical surface by longitudes and latitudes. Examples of geographic coordinates systems are WGS84, NAD\footnote{North American Datum} 1927, and NAD 1983. 

\item Projected coordinate system: This coordinate system represents the Earth's round surface on a 2D flat surface, based on a map projection as shown in Figure~\ref{figproject}. A projected coordinate system is always based on a geographic coordinate system on Earth. Each projections distort in some way the data on the Earth. It is important to know about the distortion of the particular projection when selecting it for the data projection. 
In some references, this coordinate system is also called the raw coordinate system.

In order to express the data by coordinate systems, various encodings have been developed by Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)~\cite{ogc}, while following different goals. OGC as an international consortium is the main reference to develop interface standards for geospatial content, services, data exchange, data communication, and data processing. Here we introduce only a short list of common data representation standards which are related to our study in the followings,
%Additionally, there are terms for representing a geospatial data which a list of them is as follows,
\begin{itemize}

%\item Geometry: A geometry is a datatype to represent a location or a region. 
%TODO \item: encodings, baghiye subitem bashan (http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/gis_fdd.shtml)

\item Geography Markup Language (GML): The XML based standard encoding defined by OGC, serves as a modeling language to express geographical features in both spatial and non-spatial characteristic. It is used as an interchange format in internet data storage, exchange, transport and transaction. The key to the effectiveness of GML is its capability in integrating all forms of geographic information. %TODO:ref az wikipedia!.
GML versions before the version 3.0 encodes a set of 2D geometries, i.e. Point, LineString, and Polygon. GML 3.0 introduces Curve and Surface as new geometries, plus the support of geometries in 3D.

\item Keyhole Markup Language (KML)~\cite{kml}: An XML-based grammar to encode and represent the geographic data in an 3D earth viewer such as Google Earth, also on a 2D map like Google Maps. KML has adopted as an international standard by OGC. The 3D geographic coordinates for each place are represented with longitude, latitude, and if available altitude. Coordinates are provided using the plain unprojected WGS84 longitude and latitude. The altitude could be omitted and assumed as $0$. KML mainly focuses on visualizations and expresses what and how to show. Code~\ref{kml} shows a sample data in KML.

\vspace{10px}
\item Well-known Text (WKT): A text-based markup language to represent the vector geometries which supports a big range of objects like Geometry, Point, LineString, Curve, Polygon, Surface, curvePolygon, and multi-per geometries such as MultiPoint, MultiCurve, MultiSurface. Below is examples of the WKT representaion for a Point, LineString and Polygon,
\begin{itemize}
\item Point: POINT (1 2)
\item LineSting: LINESTRING (3 1, 1 3, 4 4)
\item Polygon: POLYGON ((3 1, 4 4, 5 4, 1 2, 3 1),

\end{itemize}
\item Well-known Binary (WKB): The binary representation of WKT data to be used in a database system.
\item GeoJSON~\cite{www/geojson}: A geospatial data encoding based on the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). Supported geometries are Point, LineString, Polygon, and related multi-part geometries. An object is represented by a set of name/value pairs. The whole data are encoded as text and no advanced numeric data types are employed. It is mainly used as a lightweight text for the data interchange. The default coordinate system is WGS84, however other systems could be defined. A sample point in GeoJSON is provided in Code,

\subsection{Geospatial Data in Native XML Databases}
\label{s.geo-data-in-xml-data}
As a powerful platform-independent XML grammar introduced by GIS community(OGC), GML plays an important role in the spatial data modeling, integration, sharing, transmission, and exchange, because of its flexibility in application schema, self-descriptive format, and rich data expression. Considering XML-based structure of GML, it could be embedded and queried anywhere in the document, mixed with any other type of XML, images, etc. 
%TODO:In classic relational databases,... In XML native databases, geospatial data are handled ...

In addition to the general functions and features on the structure of GML data, geospatial concepts and requirements could be included in the native XML databases. To start with, the GML elements should be read and treated as geometries. Therefore, the string information is not enough to satisfy the geospatial features. The positions, locations, and relations between an arbitrary set of geometries raises some requirements regarding to the topics and definitions in related scientific fields like Geometry and Geoscience. For example, "What is the distance between two geometries?" or "Which geometries intersect a particular geometry?". Furthermore, there are features related to single geometries, such as the length and area of a geometry, the number of interior ring of a polygon, and the starting point of a line. These features could be provided by a database system as XQuery functions so they can be mixed with standard XQuery, full-text, and other functions.
To this date, numerous ideas have been introduced for geospatial functionalities as well as indexing. Here we discuss the geospatial index design and then we see the sample implementations in Section~\ref{s.dbs}.
%In order to investigate the related functionalities we start with the existing approaches in the indexing and the 

%Indeed in a database system the features related to a set of geometries are of more importance ...................
%TODO: We then present spatial comparisons as XQuery functions
%(similar to how the spatial operators are defined in spatial-enabled SQL
%engines) so they can be mixed with standard XQuery, full-text, etc.

%GML works nicely with XQuery and the indexing since it allows the engine to
%determine what to index, and it can be nested anywhere in an XML document.
%Furthermore, XQuery, with some additional functions to convert from the
%Well-Known Text/Binary formats used in other engines, is quite useful for
%building new GML on the fly, and parsing/validating existing GML.

\subsection{Geospatial Indexing}
\label{s.geospatial-index}
According to the survey of Chin et al~\cite{survey}, indexing has dramatic influences on the data manipulation and storage. Conventional index types are not sui to support the spatial data since the spatial data is very large and complex in structure and relations. Also, the operators used for data retrieval are complicated and spatial orderings would be hard to define. Another point which makes the traditional indices not suitable is that indexing strategies would consider the spatial objects in one dimension and do not preserve the spatial proximity.
As it is examined in this survey, a large number of spatial indexes has been introduced to fulfill the geospatial specialty and improve the spatial data retrieval. The strength or weakness of an indexing approach mostly depends on the requirements, query types, and applications for which it is developed. 
The high percentage of them has the divide and conquer algorithm~\cite{divconquer} as a basis. 
In general, Chin et al~\cite{survey} categorized all approaches to three different abstract classes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Object Mapping: Given a $k$-dimensional polygon with $n$ nodes, these approaches map this shape to a $kn$-dimensional or try to look at the shape of the polygon as a single object in the original $k$-dimensional polygon.   
\item Object Duplication: These approaches keep different instance of the object in different spaces with the similar representations to take advantage of the properties of all these spaces. 
\item Object Bounding: Similar to the idea of Quad-tree and Marching cube~\cite{marchingcube} (an approach in Computer Graphics), 
these approaches enclose the polygon as accurate as possible by dividing the space in different ways. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Trees}
\caption{An overview of some important indexing structures developed over years}
\label{trees}
\end{figure}

On the other hand, the index structures are mostly based on the famous trees like Binary-tree, B-tree~\cite{btree}, and Quad-tree. 
To see how different approaches based on the tree structres are included in these classes, 
spatial indexes are introduced briefly based on these three famous data structures. We cover just a selective list since the number of these indexing methods
is large. Figure~\ref{trees} visualizes the relation of indexing structures which were developed over years. An arrow from the structure $A$ to $B$ means $B$ is an extension of the structure $A$. The colored ovens also shows the main categories of these
trees. In the upcoming sections, these structures are briefly explained into three main categories:
Binary-tree based in Section~\ref{binary-tree-based}, 
B-tree based in Section~\ref{b-tree-based}, 
and space filling index structures in Section~\ref{quad-tree-based}.

\subsubsection{Binary-tree Based}
\label{binary-tree-based}
The indexes in this group are conceptually derived from the binary search tree. 
They adopt and generalize the idea of partitioning the space like sophisticated indexes. 
The KD-tree was very first indexing structure of this kind that was introduced by Bentley \cite{bently1975}. 
It is a generalization of the binary tree structure for organizing $k$-dimensional points. As it is explained in Bentley \cite{bently1975}, the basic idea for a 2D example is to alternatively split the area by $x$- and $y$-coordinate such that the points are splitted at each level half in left, half in right, half below, and half above respectively. Generally, for every non-leaf node, there is a $k$-th dimension discriminator which defines the left and right subtrees. More clearly, if the discriminator is associated to the $i$-th dimension, all the $i$-th attribute of the sub-nodes in left subtrees are smaller than this node and all the right subtree nodes have the greater $i$-th attribute. 

Figure~\ref{figkdtree} shows a representation of a data and the corresponding KD-tree. As it can be seen, according to the discriminator $x$ in the first level, the nodes $B, C, D$ in the left subtree of $A$ have smaller $x$ value and the nodes $E, F$ in the right subtree have greater $x$ value. In the next level that the discriminator is $y$, the same happens consequently now for $y$ values. For example, the node $C$ which is in the half below $B$, has the smaller $y$ value.

KD-tree has been used a lot in intensive searches but some variants has been introduced to make a better performance in clustering, searching, storage efficiency,  
and balancing. We discuss some of these invariants in the followings.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{kd-Tree}
\caption{A representation of KD-tree}
\label{figkdtree}
\end{figure}


\textbf{Non-homogenous KD-tree.}
A complication arises when an item is deleted from KD-tree and a node from the subtree must be replaced. This complication comes from the discriminator in that level. After the deletion, either the node with the smallest value in the right subtree should be replaced or the node with the biggest value in the left subtree. Non-homogeneous KD-tree~\cite{nonhomkdtree} was proposed to make the process of deletion cheaper. The major difference of this structure is that the partitioning is not always on different dimensions cyclically. Instead, the dimension including more range queries is selected to be the discriminator in each level. For example, the discriminator in the second level can be $x$ again instead of $y$ in two-dimensional KD-tree. 
The partitioning in this tree can happen in an arbitrary hyperplane like a line in 2D in contrast to KD-tree that a data point is always chosen for partitioning. In this partitioning, almost balanced subplances are desired.
 
\textbf{KDB-tree.} Another issue is the storage efficiency of indexing.
Since the size of indexing can grow fast to fill a huge chunk of the main memory, 
KDB-tree~\cite{kdbtree} is proposed as an extension to solve this problem. 
It takes advantage of the paging technique~\cite{bintreepaging} together with the balanced structure of KD-tree. 
KDB-tree uses a space partitioning method such that the partitions do not overlap each other.
Although this space partitioning is similar to KD-tree, more than one nodes can be stored together as pages. 
Then, these pages are stored as nodes of KD-tree.
KDB-tree has two basic structures: region and point pages. A region page as an internal node contains a description of the bounding region enclosing its children and the reference to the children. 
%\todo the figure is not correct.
A point page as a leaf node carries the object identifiers. Therefore, different pages are kept in different parts of memory instead of a huge chunk. 
As shown in Figure~\ref{figkdbtree}, $D$, $E$, $F$, and $G$ subspaces are disjoint and shape together the region $A$ as the parent node. Here, the black small points in the leaf nodes are representing the objects. Also, the hatched areas in each node is the regions which are not included the page of that node. 
It should be mentioned that there is a trade-off between being height-balanced and the storage efficiency.
Then, the storage efficiency can be poorer in some cases. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{kdbtree}
\caption{A representation of KDB-tree}
\label{figkdbtree}
\end{figure}

\textbf{HB-tree.} 
Splitting the region nodes is inevitable for keeping the balance of KDB-tree during the modification processes. This splitting is done by intersecting the data space with a plane. This intersection does not cross the actual borders of the previously found subregions. Then, new subspaces would be produced. This means splitting can propagate to the children resulting in more and more sparse nodes in lower levels. HB-tree (holey brick B-tree)~\cite{hbtree1} as a multi-attribute index structure is proposed to solve this prolem. HB-tree allows data spaces to be divided along more than one dimension. 
%It permits rectagular holes inside a data space by partitioning along pieces of several dimensions. 
This gives more flexibility in patitioning and serves as a solution for the cases where partitioning a region along one entire dimension forces splitting of the children subregion. This structure also helps to distribute the objects in subspaces more evenly when it is not possible by cutting across one dimension. As Figure~\ref{hbtree} illustrates, partitioning along one dimension in~\ref{hbsplita} results in uneven division of data while two-dimesional split in~\ref{hbsplitb} divides the objects more evenly.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\subfigure[Single-dimensional split of data points]{
\includegraphics[width=0.22\textwidth,height=0.12\textheight]{hbtree1}h
%\caption{R-tree structure}

\subfigure[Two-dimensional split of data points]{

%\caption{R-tree}
\label{hbsplitb}
}
\caption{Partitioning of data space in HB-tree (based on~\cite{tree-basedindexes})}
\label{hbtree}
\end{figure}

To represent the holey regions, HB-tree uses KD-tree within internal nodes to organize the information about the lower levels. It means that more complex data structure is required to represent a node. In addition, it might happen that a region is referenced by more than one leaf of KD-tree in internal nodes of HB-tree, such as node $G$ in Figure~\ref{fighbtree}. Splitting along $y$ in third level results in dividing into two subtrees, one having $1/3$ and the other $2/3$ of the nodes. To achieve this, the subtree with node $x_2$ shows the splitt along $x$ in the next level and therefore duplicates $G$ in both right and left subtrees. The subtrees with root noeds $x_1$, $x_2$, $y_3$, and $y_5$ are extracted to shows $F$ and $C$ regions.
%, since part of it is below and the other part is above $y_5$. Obviously, $F$ is in the left subtree as the lower region. Then, in the next level, partitioning along $x$ dimnesion puts $G$ in left and $F$ in right. This means, to represent the "hole"

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth,height=0.2\textheight]{hbtree}
\caption{A representation of HB-tree (source~\cite{hbtree1})}
\label{fighbtree}
\end{figure}

%In HB-tree leaf nodes are called \textit{data nodes} and internal nodes are \textit{index nodes}. 
%Index nodes  
%A data space can be non-rectangular and space representation in internal nodes is by KD-trees. The leaf nodes are known as data nodes and the internal node as index nodes. An index node data space is a union of its child node subspaces which are obtained through KD-tree recursive partitioning.
As~\cite{hbtree1} states, removing the sparse nodes of the KDB-tree, gives better search and insert performance and decent space utilization in HB-tree. Nevertheless, expensive deletion and splitting are and multiple references to a data node that may lead to more than one traversal of a path are trade-off.

\textbf{Matsuyama KD-tree.} Since KD-trees are designed as a point access method, the variant structure introduced by Matsuyama et al~\cite{matsuyama} is suitable for non-point objects via adding an extensive duplication strategy. In order to achieve this, a data page is associated to each leaf node containing pointer to the objects. Those objects that overlap several unpartiotioned spaces will be referenced in all corresponding pages. As mentioned in~\cite{survey}, this structure is not appropriate for data with large objects due to duplication.

\textbf{4D-tree.} Another extension of KD-tree to make it useful for two-dimensional rectangular objects, is 4D-tree~\cite{4dtree}. 4D-tree maps objects into four-dimensional points which are indexed in KD-tree. It means a rectangle $(x‍‍_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$ is considered as the point $(x‍‍_1, y_1, x_2, y_2)$. Similar to KD-tree, discriminator in each level is chosen repeatedly from the set $(x‍‍_1, y_1, x_2, y_2)$. For each node, a discriminator, a discriminator value, and pointers to two children are stored. 
For a region search $(qx_1, qx_2, qy_1, qy_2)$, depending on the discriminator, the result of one of the following operators,
$$x_1 \leq qx_2, \quad x_2 \geq qx_1, \quad y_1 \leq qy_2, \quad y_2 \geq qy_1,$$ 
determines which subtree (or both) has to be searched.
The major problem of this approach is the high cost of its intersection search when the query needs propagating in both subtrees. 


\textbf{SKD-tree.} The Spatial KD-Tree (SKD-tree)~\cite{skdtree} alters KD-tree such that the object duplication and object mapping is avoided. Similar to 4D-tree, it is proposed to handle non-point spatial objects. These objects may extend in more than one subspace in KD-tree. To prevent those objects to be divided and referenced multiple times, SKD-tree defines a virtual subspace for each subspace produced in KD-tree. Each virtual subspace determines the bounding area of all objects with the centroid inside the original subspaces. It means even though an object is not totally contained in the original subspace, it can be contained in the corresponding virtual subspace. More clearly, the objects will be placed in subspaces based on their centroid. Therefore, each node has the following parts necessarily~\cite{skdtreebook},
\begin{itemize}
\item Pointers to two children
\item The level discriminator
\item The level discriminator value
\item The maximum and minimum values of the left and right subtree objects respectively in the dimension that discriminator belongs to.
\end{itemize}    
As Chin et al~\cite{survey} states, the SKD-tree directory is stored in secondary memory. Figure~\ref{figskdtree} illustrates the way that minimum and maximum boundries of each space is determined to shape a virtual subspace. In this example, the discrimator for the root node is $x$ with the value of $x_6$.
The maximum boundary of the rectangle $r_3$ is $x_7$ which defines the maximum boundary of the left virtual subspace. Correspondingly, the minimum boundary of the right subspace is $x_5$ which the right boundary of the rectangle $r_8$.

\caption{An example of the SKD-tree structure (source~\cite{survey})}
\label{figskdtree}
\end{figure} 
SKD-tree is at the advantage when the virtual subspace may bound the objects tighter than the partitioning line. In such cases, the intersection search cuts the search space efficiently. The containment search is directly supported in this structure and is useful to operators, like \textit{within} and \textit{contain}, since all objects, which are not contained totally in the query region, are ignored.
As SKD-tree is memory-based, not disk-based, it is not suitable for very large databases.

%Main memory storage of the index trees are mostly a problem, since it is too big to be placed there  [survay]. Hence, the storage has to be done into disk space. Using binary search tree paging techniques [CeS82 survay] or tree organization of B-trees [BaM72 survay] to store the kd-Tree proposes new indexing structures.
%Using properties of both kd-tree and B-tree [reference], the KDB-tree rebuilds the kd-tree to improve some inefficiencies of it.  It means benefits of the balanced kd-trees and the I/O efficiency of B-trees are together. It uses the disk space to bring the kd-tree on disk. 

 


\subsubsection{B-tree based Indexing Technique}
\label{b-tree-based}
B-tree is used extensively in databases due to its flexibility and ability to handle a large amount of data. However, it is not designed for the data in multi-dimensional spaces. Then it is not suitable for spatial searches like other classical one-dimensional index structures. Frequent queries in geospatial applications, such as finding the all places within $20 km$ of a point, make it important to find the objects according to their spatial location in a space. 

R-tree~\cite{rtree} as one of the spatial indexing structures, extends B-tree by adding the support of multi-dimensional data. It also inherits the height balance from B-tree. This structure is designed based on the idea of grouping the neighbouring objects and representing them with their minimum bounding rectangle (MBR). This idea minimizes the visiting area in spatial search queries. Shapes and objects are described in leaf nodes by rectangles containing a single object. Each non-leaf node in higher levels is the smalles bounding rectangle spatially containing its children, either the rectangles or objects. The root node with at least two children, is the biggest minimum bounding rectangle which spatially contains the whole objects. Figure~\ref{rtree} represent how an R-tree is built for a spatial data set. Figure~\ref{rtreebox} illustrates the minimum bounding rectangles calculated for different levels
% from those which contain the single objects to those containing the whole area. 
and the corresponding R-tree is shown in Figure~\ref{rtreestruct}.
It should be mentioned that this structure is designed for disk storage.
Figure~\ref{rtreestruct} also shows that leaf nodes point to the data tuples on disk.
%More clearly, the leaf nodes in R-tree are the actual shapes while
%other nodes are minimum bounding boxes of the actual geospatial data. Here, 
%the actual bounding boxes have the dimension of the data.

\caption{A sample of R-tree creation for a set of data objects in 2D}
\label{rtree}
\end{figure}

According to Chin et al~\cite{survey}, the operations on the R-tree 
are basically the same as the operations in B-tree. The only difference is that the 
whole operations have to be done on bounding rectangles.
Also, the order used in the element placement in B-tree
is the set inclusion order on bounding rectangles and shapes in leaf nodes. 

Partitioning the area with MBRs is the challenging point about R-tree. 
Since the rectangles are areas to be investigated in spatial calculations, minimizing both their coverage area and overlappings is crucial to the performance of R-tree. Therefore, splittings should result in the minimum total area of rectangles and minimum overlapping of each two rectangles. 
Achieving these goals are largely dependent on the splitting algorithm chosen for defining the bounding rectangles. Figure~\ref{rtreesplit} illustrates this point by two different splits. Total coverage area of the "Bad aplit" case in this sample is larger than the "Good split" and this will lead to unnecessary investigation of empty spaces.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth,height=0.17\textheight]{R-treeMBR}
\caption{Two different split strategies in R-tree (created based on~\cite{rtree})}
\label{rtreesplit}
\end{figure}

As mentioned before, the idea of bounding rectangles helps to decide which parts of the tree have to be visited in search queries, such as intersection, overlapping, and containment. In fact, the following steps are taken to run a query,
\begin{enumerate}
\item Filtering: This step selects those rectangles which overlap the query area.
\item Spatial Operation: The requested spatial operation is applied on the selected rectangles from the previous step. 
\item This process continues until it reaches those rectangles containig single objects. 
\item At the end selected objects are checked against the query operation. 
\end{enumerate}
Figure~\ref{rtreequery} illustrates how an intersection query is done on the R-tree and how the rectangles are chosen to be included in calculations. In this example, the rectangles $R_2$, $R_5$, $R_6$, $R_{12}$, and $R_{14}$ are selected to be checked while the other areas remain untouced. At the end $R_{12}$ and $R_{14}$ are selected as rectangles containing the final results.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth,height=0.2\textheight]{Rtree-query}
\caption{Querying R-tree}
\label{rtreequery}
\end{figure}

R-tree benefits from the highly balanced structure and usually optimized implementation for secondary storage. Furthurmore, it gives a good perofrmance in low-dimensional spaces. Generally, R-tree is appropriate and common spatial index for both point and extended spatial data. However, there are two main disadvantages according to Manolopoulos et al~\cite{Manolopoulos:2005}, which motivate to revise the structure towards more efficient variations. First, point-location queries may lead to visit multiple paths in tree which detregates performance, specially when MBRs overlappings are considerable. Second, investigating empty spaces of large rectangles which have significant overlaps, deteriorates the performance. Here, we briefly explain some variations of R-tree to see how they alter the structure to prevent disadvantages.


\textbf{$R^+$-tree.}
To avoid the above-mentioned disadvantages of R-tree, $R^+$-tree~/cite{Sellis:rplustree} is introduce as a compromise between R-tree and KDB-tree. In simple words, $R^+$-tree avoids overlapping of internal nodes (rectangles) at the same level in tree. To obtain this, objects will be inserted in more than one leaf if necessary. Figure~\ref{r+tree} shows an example of an $R^+$-tree together with its corresponding planer representation. As it can be seen, the node $e$ which is partially cantained in both rectangles $C$ and $B$, is referenced twice in the leaf nodes.

%It has just some difference:
%Nodes of an R+-tree are not guaranteed to be at least half filled.
% The entries of any intermediate (internal) node do not overlap.
% An object identifier may be stored in more than one leaf node.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{r+tree}
\caption{An {$R^+$-tree} example}
\label{r+tree}
\end{figure}

With the changes made in structure, {$R^+$-tree} is at some advantages. Point query performance benefits from abscence of overlappings and instead of several paths, a single path is traversed and consequently fewer nodes are visited in queries. On the other hand, there are some disadvantages. 
%The duplication of the objects avoids overlapping and consequently leads to less path traversals in point queries. 
%On the other hand there is some disadvantages: 
{$R^+$-tree} might be bigger than R-Tree as a result of duplicated rectangle. Additionally, construction and maintenance are more complex. In addition, more complex deletion algorithm is another drawback of the approach of avioding overlaps.  
According to Günther~\cite{efficientstruct}, there is another problem in {$R^+$-tree} algorithm which could happen in some insertions. It happens when the covering rectangles do not allow each other to expand in order to include the inserted object. As a result, the so-called \textit{dead spaces} are produced in the current structure that cannot be covered. It means if a new object places in those regions, it cannot be fully covered. To cover the uncovered areas, one or more rectangles have to be split and this leads in split of some children as well. This case degrades the storage efficiency. However, Chin et al~\cite{survey} states that {$R^+$-tree} perform generally better for smaller objects and slightly worse for larger objects.
%In performance study, in the comparison between R-trees and R+-trees, it is found that the R+-tree requires much more splits, especially for large data objects, but lesser splits for smaller data objects. 

\textbf{The Cell Tree}
To avoid the overlapping problem of R-tree and \textit{dead spaces} in $R^+$-tree, the cell tree~\cite{celltree} was introduced. The partitions in the cell tree may be convex polyhedral as bounding polygons, instead of rectangles, such that the partitions do not overlap (see Figure~\ref{figcelltree}). Since some spatial object are shaped irregularly, to better approximate them a convex polyhedral is composed of a set of polyhedral. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{CellTree}
\caption{An Example of a cell tree (source~\cite{survey})}
\label{figcelltree}
\end{figure}

Similar to $R^+$-tree, objects may be stored in more than one leaf if necessary. This could lead to division of new objects in order to place them in bounding polygons that do not overlap. This will be more serious in populated DBs. The solutions proposed to evercome this problem by Chin et al~\cite{survey}, improves storage efficieny, but does not give significant query performance. 

\textbf{$R^*$-tree}
In order to improve achieve better performance, $R^*$-tree~\cite{rstartree} goes beyond the MBR area minimization with trying following criteria, as Manolopoulos et al~\cite{Manolopoulos:2005} explains,
\begin{itemize}
\item Minimizing the covered area by MBRs to minimize the dead spaces which leads to fewer paths to be traversed in queries. 
\item Minimizing the MBRs overlap to reduce the paths followed by queries.
\item minimizing the MBR margins to shape squarish/quadratic rectangles which improve the performance of queries with large quadratic shapes.
\item Maximizing of storage utilization. 
\end{itemize}
In fact, unlike R-tree which determines the MBRs according to their area, $R^*$-tree determines them based on theier area, margins of space, and overlap with other MBRs. Additionally, \textit{Forced Reinsertion} is a key concept in this algorithm which delets and reinserts elements of a full node to prevent splits.
To find the best combination of the criteria, it is necessary to implement an approch, since the criteria can conflict sometimes. The optimizations is obtained with revised node split and also forced reinsertion which finds a better place for a node than its original place. This revised structure result in the following performance improvements,
\begin{itemize}
\item More rectangular pages produced by the revised split algorithm are better for many applications.
\item Performance optimization is gained through the reinsertion method, however increases the complication.
\end{itemize}
As Beckmann et al~\cite{rstartree} states, the efficiency of $R^*$-tree is generally better than R-tree and other variants and with the expensive insertion, $R^*$-tree is an improved approach. The major reason for effectiveness and attractiveness of $R^*$-tree compared to R-tree, is its slightly higher implementation cost, while revised insertion and split algorithm give better performance.
% $R^*$-tree is found to be more efficient than some other variants,
%and R-tree using linear splitting algorithm is substantially less efficient than the one with quadratic splitting algorithm. 
%In general, $R^*$-tree is an improvement over the R-tree at the expense of more expensive insertion.

%This structure tries to reduce overlaps between directory rectangles and the area covered by a rectangle, in order to make better performance, since minimum overlaps leads to less number of branches to be traversed in queries and minimum coverage helps to decide on the paths to traverse on higher levels. 
%R*-Tree does these optimizations with revised node split and also forced insertion which finds a better place for a node that its original place. In R-Tree insertion-build structure is highly suboptimal and insertion and deletion could improves the R-Tree dramatically.
%(Using the idea of reinsertion of the R-tree, Beckmann et al proposed a reinsertion algorithm when a node overflows. The reinsertion sorts the entries in decreasing order of the distance between the centroids of the rectangle and the covering rectangle and reinserts the first p (variable for tuning) entries. In some cases, the entries are reinserted back into the same node and hence a split is eventually necessary. The reinsertion will no doubt increase the storage utilization; but it can be fairly expensive when the tree is large. 
%The R*-tree is found to be more efficient than some other variants, and the R-tree using linear splitting algorithm is substantially less efficient than the one with quadratic splitting algorithm. In general, the R*-tree is an improvement over the R-tree at the expense of more expensive insertion.)

%\textbf{The Buddy Tree.}
%(In comparison to previously proposed tree structures such as the K-D-B-tree, the buddy-tree guarantees a more efficient dynamic behavior.Moreover, indirect splits which cause low storage utilization and high insertion costs in the K-D-B-tree, are completely avoided. This structure is 
%It avoids the downward splitting of the K-DB-tree, the overlapping problem of the R-tree and the dependency of structures upon the insertion of data. The buddy-tree generalizes the buddy system of the grid-file to organize correlated data efficiently, by bounding the data points tightly using the bounding rectangle concepts of the R-tree and organize the directory as in the R-tree. Like grid-files, the non-zero sized data have to be mapped into higher dimension.
%An important feature of the buddy-tree is that it does not partition empty data space. Therefore queries, such as partial match queries, where the query region intersects with empty data space, can be performed much faster than by conventional structures partitioning the complete data space.
%The following summarizes the design properties of the buddy-tree:
%empty data space is not partitioned insertion and deletion of a record is restricted to
%exactly one path no overflow pages directory grows linear in the number of records
%performance is basicly independent of the sequence of
%insertions efficient behavior for insertions and deletions very high fan out of the directory nodes)

\textbf{The Packed R-Tree}
In order to minimize storage space, coverages and overlaps in R-Tree, statically constructed R-tree is proposed by Roussopoulos and Leifker~\cite{packedrtree, packedrtree2}, called Packed R-tree. To build this tree, first the objects are ordered along one coordinate, e.g.$X$. The object with the minimum value of the coordinate, then is chosen to find the \textit{M nearest objects} to that one and assign them to it. Here, $M$ is the maximum number of objects that are allowed in a page. This step is repeated until the whole objects are assigned to a node. The bounding box of the leaf nodes are higher level objects which are ordered and assigned to the nodes as well. The process repeats until the remaining nodes can be placed in a page and at the end those nodes are assigned to the root. 
To achieve the best minimization of covering rectangles, 
%The main objective of this algorithm is to reduce the storage space, the coverage and overlap of rectangles, in order to improve the search efficiency.


\textbf{STR-tree}
Another paking algorithm to build static R-tree is Sort-Tile-Recursive (STR)~\cite{strtree}. Dynamically building an R-tree may not give always the best stucture, in addition to high load time and sunptimal space utilization. Therefore, static creation in cases which data do not change frequently is at an advantage. STR approach sorts the rectangles by $X$ coordinate and then place them into $\sqrt(r/n)$ vertical slices such that he number of rectangles in each tile is $\sqrt(r/n)$. Here, $r$ is the number of total rectangles and $n$ is the maximum number of rectangles that can be inserted in each node. Then, the rectangles are sorted bt $y$ coordinates. At the end, the rectangles are inserted in tree nodes in the sorted order.
As stated in \cite{strtree} this structure, as well as the other packing structures such as \textit{Nearest-X} and \textit{Hilbert Sort}, improves the space utilization and query performance. 

\textbf{X-tree}
X-tree, proposed by Berchtold et al~\cite{xtree}, is another extension to support high-dimensional data processing. X-tree focuses on prevention of MBRs overlaps in order to minimize the amount of paths that have to be traversed. Unlike $R^+$-tree, this approach does not split a data region. Instead, follows more complex algorithm by analyzing the size of overlap occured for each split. Then, decides on choosing the minimum overlap or creating a new kind of node, called \textit{supernode}. \textit{Supernode} refers to internal nodes which containing more data values and pointers than maxmimum capacity of normal nodes (see Figure~\ref{figxtree}). This will help to decrease the tree levels and consequently improve search queries efficiency.

\caption{Structure of the X-tree}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Space Filling Index structures}
\label{quad-tree-based}
Among this category of structures, here we explain briefly Quad-tree~\cite{quadtree} as the one describing hierarchial spatial data structure whichis based on theprinciple of recursive decomposition, like some of the forementioned structures. The goal of this design was to design a structure in main memory and only for two-dimensional data. The common structure, called \textit{region Quad-tree} is based on the subdivision into four equal-size quadrants. It means each internal node has four children. The spaces may have rectangular or any arbitraty shape. The leaf nodes represent the corresponding data contained in a region. 
Other variants of Quad-tree have been introduced to avoid the existing problems and aim at different goals, such as Quad-CIF-tree, PR Quad-tree, MX Quad-tree, and MX-CIF Quad-tree. However, they all satisfy common properties. 
However Quad-tree benefits the simple implementation and good performance for two-dimensional data, if the tree is balanced, in high- dimensional spaces is not useful. Also, the performance is not alway good since it is not usually balanced and main memory maintenance of the structure is tricky duo to poor IO performance. 
%It is organized in a way similar to the region quad-tree. A region is recursively partitioned until the resulting quadrants do not contain any rectangle. During the subdivision, all rectangles that intersect with either of the two partitioning lines are associated with the partitioning lines. The rectangles that are associated with a quadrant must not belong to any ancestor quadrant. It is assumed that no two rectangles overlap.

\section{Related Work}
\label{s.rwork}
%Investigating the various algorithms and ideas helps to gain an insight into developing a convenient way of indexing in BaseX which suits the systems. However, 
Investigating the various concepts of geospatial processing in XML databases helps to gain an insight into further solutions and developments. 
Based on our investigations, we will mostly be discussing three main areas: storage, querying, and indexing. There is large amount of researches and literature in these topics from which we summarize selected ones here. Besides, the geospatial processing issues in three famous databases are reviewed which might be beneficial to design the properly fitting solutions in BaseX. %TODO: three famous databases -> or four when monetdb is written.

%This section is organized as follows.
Since GML data type is our focus, we mainly concentrate on the topics related to this standard. Section~\ref{storage} introduces the approaches regarding the storage of geospatial data in GML. 
These approaches are investigated with respect to the effectiveness of storage models in terms of query processing. The proposed querying ideas will be explained in Section~\ref{queryLang}. 
Finally, we will look at the databases in Section~\ref{s.dbs} and how they handle the geospatial data and provide the related features.
  
\subsection{Storage}
\label{storage}
One of the basic approaches to store GML data is proposed in Li et al~\cite{Li2004} to store both spatial and non-spatial data in a spatial database, like Oracle Spatial and PostGIS/Postgres SQL. This approach first generates the schema tree and then maps it into the relational schema to store all spatial objects as the values of table fields in the spatial database. Geospatial queries can be submitted 
in an XQuery-like language with spatial functional extensions. These GML queries are translated into the equivalent SQL queries which are evaluated using the spatial database management system. 
A similar approach is discussed in Xu et al~\cite{Zhu2011} to store and query the GML data focusing on non-schema documents. After the generation of GML parse tree, the nodes are analyzed and schema mapping is generated to store the document in an object-relational database. 
Both spatial and non-spatial queries are also supported in this approach.

In contrast to the mentioned approaches, Zhang et al~\cite{Zhang2008} considers the characteristics of XML databases and stores the GML data in the original format without any conversion or mapping to a relational or object-oriented database. 
It supports also the self-descriptive and semi-structural characteristics of XML.
This is only one of the many strategies which propose a native XML database, considering the GML structure in storage and querying. 
In general, these kinds of strategies follow the below steps,
\begin{enumerate}
\item Import and parse the GML schema
\item Map the feature object and document schema
\item Establish the corresponding collection in the database
\item Import the GML document according to the parsed schema
\item Partition and store the GML document into the corresponding collection
\item Record the log file containing the GML partitioning information
\end{enumerate}
Zhang et al~\cite{Zhang2008} as an example of these approaches develops a prototype system based on \textit{Java API for XML Processing} (JAXP) and JTS~\cite{jts} library to implement the above-mentioned steps. 
This prototype contains three building blocks: the schema mapping constructor, the document storage tool, 
and the spatial analyzer.

Another challenging issue in storage is the size of GML data that is commonly huge. 
We bring one example of several research papers in this area to complete the discussion over the storage.
Wei~\cite{Wei2011} discusses a query-friendly compression of GML file in SAX document 
parsing which does not consider the full decompression for both the direct and the spatial path querying. 
Briefly, this approach generates three different structures from the SAX parsing event
which are an event hierarchy, an event dictionary, and a binary event tree.
All these three structures together with the document contents are stored in a compact
representation to be used in partial decompression for querying.%in "to be used ..." ro az khodam neveshtam, akhe jomle ye juri nesfe nime b nazar miresid.

\subsection{Geospatial Query Languages}
\label{queryLang}
Numerous contributions have been done toward introducing a GML query language.
Here, we summarize just a short list of them trying to cover the various ideas we have met. %based on different approaches. 
Section~\ref{xquery-based} starts the discussion with the XQuery based languages which extends the XQuery
to process the GML data.
Then, we bring related work regarding the integration of geospatial and non-geospatial
data from different sources in Section~\ref{integration}. This integration is a matter of interest
as the data is mostly is a mixed of both types. The knowledge- or ontology-based approaches 
come next in Section~\ref{ontology}.

\subsubsection{XQuery-based Languages}
\label{xquery-based}
XQuery language, recommended by \emph{W3C}, as a powerful query programming language for structured and non-structured data, 
is not applicable to spatial data, as it is discussed in~\cite{Lisa2006,Chen2010}. 
However, Li~\cite{Lisa2006} concludes that XQuery is suitable to be expanded in order to develop a spatial query language.
It is emphasized that the GML data should be treated different than XML data. Hence, Li~\cite{Lisa2006} chooses XQuery as the base language to expand into a GML query language. The proposed language supports not only predefined GML elements but also it is flexible to handle various GML data. 
It means a query can be designed without knowing the concrete elements of the GML document.
Code~\ref{qlang1} is an example of this language and its flexibility
which retrieves all geometries within a region. As it can be seen, 
the common vocabularies such as \textit{feature} and \textit{geometry} are used and no concrete tag names or datatypes are mentioned.
In addition, a set of operators and functions is appended that covers the typical queries over the geospatial data. 
In comparison with the similar contributions, this approach is applicable not for predefined GML types, but to any type.

\vspace{10px}
\begin{fakeXML}[label=qlang1,caption=A query example of a flexible query language.]
for $feature in gfn:getFeatures(doc(“sample.xml”))
where gfn:within(gfn:getGeometry($feature), gml:Envelop(...))
return $feature
\end{fakeXML}
\vspace{10px}

Another contribution which supports the idea of integrating GML and XQuery is presented in Chen~\cite{Chen2010}.
It introduces a new GML query language, named GXQuery. 
Adding spatial data types and operations to XQuery, based on the OGC Simple Features Specification for SQL, 
Chen~\cite{Chen2010} represents the architecture and implementation methods of GXQuery 
which supports spatial, non-spatial, and mixed spatial and non-spatial queries. 
The GXQuery engine is composed of XQuery engine, GML parser, spatial extension module 
and a module of GML index interface. 
A component based on the JTS API is implemented in this engine
to be used as the base of spatial extension. 
A typical spatial and non-spatial query example of GXQuery is given in Code~\ref{qlang2}.
This query checks if two geometries corresponding to the "Building" features from 
"Campus.gml" file are spatially equal. This file contains the data representing
the facilities of a university campus.
\vspace{10px}
\begin{fakeXML}[escapechar=\!,label=qlang2,caption=A typical example of combined spatial and non-spatial query in GXQuery.]
for $var1 in doc(“Campus.gml”)//Building,
    $var2 in doc(“Campus.gml”)//Building
where 
    $var1/gml:name/node()=! “Library”! and $var2/@fid =! “l0028”! 
return geo:Equals($var1, $var2)
\end{fakeXML}
\vspace{10px}

A final example of XQuery-based GML database is Fubao~\cite{Fubao2010}
which expands the data model, algebra, functions, operations, and formal semantics in XQuery 
to achieve a GML query processor. New spatial datatypes and operators are added to XQuery to support both spatial and mix (spatial and non-spatial) queries. Unlike the previously mentioned approach in Chen~\cite{Chen2010}, supported data types are limited to Geometry, Coord, Coordinates, Point, LineString, LinearRing, Polygon, Box, GeometryCollection, MultiPoint, MultiLineString, and MultiPolygon. 
These data types are actually the predefined ones in this method.
The spatial operations which are defined in this method are as follows,
\begin{itemize}
\item simple geometry operation, such as calculating the envelope, boundary, or dimension of a geometry
\item spatial relation operation, such as finding the overlapping, containing, and touching relations of geometries
\item spatial analysis operations, such as finding the union, difference, or intersection of two geometries
\item geometry-specific operations, such as finding the start-point of a line or the interior ring of a polygon.
\end{itemize}
The spatial computations are handled again by the related JTS functions in background.

\subsubsection{Knowledge- or Ontology-based Approaches}
\label{ontology}
In addition to the XQuery-based language developments, 
other concepts of spatial query languages have already been developed. 
Alemdros~\cite{Alemdros2011, Alemdros2013} defines a semantic version of XPath 
which is not based on the tree-based (syntactic) structure of GML. Instead, a system is developed to implement a query language based on the semantic structure of GML. More clearly, the GML schema is used to define the queries. However, a semantic content can be structured in several syntaxes. The system stores GML by PostGIS database system and transforms the XPath-based GML queries into the SQL language, considering the GML schema in order to execute semantic based queries. The results of these queries are visualized by exporting into the KML format.

{Gutiérrez et al}~\cite{Gutierrez2004} also brings a new idea and presents a knowledge-based approach 
to query heterogeneous spatial databases by identifying not only the entity classes but also the similar instances. 
It means the database uses a conceptual schema to do the queries. 
The queries based on the ontology and conceptual similarities 
are transformed into a formal specification of entity classes 
which are compared against the definitions in the database. 
This process is carried out by determining the conceptual similarity between entities in a user ontology 
and by comparing the entities in ontology with the entities in conceptual models of databases. 
In addition to the specification of the idea, the system architecture, the user ontology, 
a conceptual schema are provided in this effort.

Another important task that is handled by Ontology-based queries is to query 
the data of different format and from various sources,
like legacy data stored in databases, shape files, 
or even the feature data in Web Feature Services (WFS).
Since a huge amount of the geospatial data is increasingly provided
distributed over sources,
a sharing accesses strategy is extremely needed.
Zhao et al~\cite{Zhao2008} presents a method to spatial data 
interoperability at semantic level by an interface in RDF ontology. 
There is no need to replicate legacy data stored in relational databases, shapefiles, or GML data accessible through WFS. Instead, the queries are written to WFS \textit{getFeature} request and SQL statements in databases. 
This interface provides an ontology layer for geospatial data accessible through WFS services or databases. 
The queries are written in the common terms of the domain and application ontology. 
The interface uses the spatial query functions of WFS servers for feature rendering and relational databases as sources for non-spatial data, since this can improve the performance of non-spatial queries. 

As a completion to the discussion from the previous paragraph, a work is presented here to 
discuss the whole idea of the geospatial processing from wen.
The web technology which is widely used nowadays, 
was an area investigated by Corcoles~\cite{corcoles2003} for the geospatial data. 
This effort proposes an approach to integrate geospatial data on the Web by focusing on the definition of a mapping between the ontology and the DTD/Schemas. 
Geospatial data in this work is stored in GML format and a query language is designed for querying each GML document in the same way. 
Moreover, ontologies solve the semantic heterogeneity of different GML documents 
by defining a catalog in RDF such that this catalog establishes a correspondence.

\subsubsection{Integration of Spatial and Non-Spatial Data}
\label{integration}
Toward integrating spatial and non-spatial data from different sources, 
it is necessary to develop an integration system. 
Corcoles~\cite{corcoles2003} discusses a prototype of an integration mediator for querying the spatial XML resources. 
This approach mainly provides an interface or global schema for querying the resources with different schema. 
This global schema is a simple object-oriented structure in RDF described as an ontology. 
More clearly, this work provides the infrastructure for formulating structured spatial queries 
considering the conceptual representation of a specific domain, like the information of New York, 
in the form of an ontology. The mediator translates the queries in terms of RDFS to queries which refer to the schemes of GML resources.
 % The resources are integrated using RDF. The most novel and critical feature of this approach is the querying of spatial XML resources, because it uses a different way from that of querying and relating non-spatial resources.

Regarding the integration issues, Belussi et al\cite{belussi2006} explains a problem which arises from the different representation of spatial data in various resources or even in integration scenarios or architectures. For example, one dataset represents roads and bridges as regions, another dataset represents roads as regions and bridges as lines, and a third dataset represents both as lines. 
In cases the user wants to query this spatial data integrated with non-spatial data, 
there would be indeed some gaps in the stored data. 
Here, this gap might cause difficulties in querying as well as some inaccuracies in the results. 
This integration approach introduces a solution based on a query relaxation mechanism 
to return approximated results with possibility of specifying maximal error allowed
in the execution by the user. 
%In this study, the relaxation problem for spatial topological queries is considered. 
In particular, some relaxed topological predicates, called \textit{weak}, and the related application contexts in terms of application scenarios are presented to show their usability. Moreover, an existing XQuery-based GML query language is extended to support similarity-based queries through the proposed operators and to handle the \textit{weak} topological predicates, from the syntax and implementation perspective. 
This language uses also the JTS API to provide spatial object model and fundamental topological
functions and relations. Below, sample queries in this language are shown,  
%In order to make such predicates effectively usable, the way that GQuery, an XML-based spatial query language, can be extended to support similarity-based queries through the proposed operators is also discussed.
\vspace{10px}
\begin{itemize}
\item Determine all roads overlapping some bridges
\begin{fakeJSON}
for $x in document(bridge.xml), $y in document(road.xml)
where overlap($x/geometry, $y/geometry) = true
return $x
\end{fakeJSON}
\item Determine all roads overlapping some bridge, up to a 22\% error
\begin{fakeJSON}
for $x in document(bridge.xml), $y in document(road.xml)
where overlap($x/geometry, $y/geometry,R,L,0.22) = true
return $x 
\end{fakeJSON}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Geospatial Processing in Databases} 
\label{s.dbs}
Besides analyzing various general ideas of geospatial processing in databases, it would be advantageous to know the geospatial features and functionalities in well-known database systems. In this section, we briefly introduce the geospatial issues in the widely used databases, MongoDB, eXist, MarkLogic, and MonetDB as all of them have geospatial functionalities. We will see how the different ideas are provided and used in practice.

\subsubsection{MongoDB}
\label{mongo}
MongoDB~\cite{mongogeneral2010,mongoinaction2011} is one of the leading databases used specially in web applications. Here, we consider the $2.4$ version series of this software. MongoDB supports both flat and spherical space in geospatial processing. Geospatial features in MongoDB are mainly executed by a few operators which can be combined to produce more advance queries based on the use cases. 
The operators are \textit{\$geoIntersects}, \textit{\$geoWithin}, \textit{\$near}, and \textit{\$nearSphere} which first indicate the query operation. Then, the geometry specifiers serve to form the query conditions. These specifiers, \textit{\$geometry}, \textit{\$maxDistance}, \textit{\$center}, \textit{\$box}, \textit{\$centerSphere}, \textit{\$polygon}, and \textit{\$uniqueDocs}, define the various geometries and conditions in GeoJSON or in legacy coordinate pairs to filter the results. The calculation units in the spherical space can be meter or radian. The units in the flat space are determined by the given coordinate system. 

Apart from the operators, some particular geospatial queries can be done through the geospatial commands, 
\textit{geoNear}, \textit{geoSearch}, and \textit{geoWalk}. The command \textit{geoNear} is an alternative to the \textit{\$near} operator which returns additional information, for example the distance of each returned item from the given point or some troubleshooting diagnostic information. The command \textit{geoSearch} is an interface to use the haystack index and \textit{geoWalk} is an internal command.

\textbf{The Geospatial Index.}
The geospatial index in MongoDB is based on the \textit{geohash}~\cite{www/geohash} data structure. Regarding the importance of geohash, we shortly explain it before discussing the index in detail.

The geohash value is calculated by recursively dividing the space into buckets of grids and assigns a two-bit value to each part (Figure~\ref{figmongoindex}). This number, called geohash value, does not really point to the coordinates, rather the boundings of the coordinate is represented. 
As the division goes further, the geohash values are becoming longer and the areas are becoming smaller. 
At the end, we will have a hierarchical spatial structure. Here are some properties of geohashing,
\begin{itemize}
\item It provides a short, concise, expressive, and as accurate as necessary representation of locations which have not to be a precise point.
\item It simply groups the points by giving the whole places of a quadrant the same value. Nearby places often share similar prefixes. Conversely, the longer a shared prefix is, the closer the two places are. 
\item Arbitrary precision and the possibility of gradually removing characters from the end of the code to reduce its size and precision is properties that geohash offers. Therefore, it allows to zoom into the areas to select the level of precision.
\item It facilitates the unique identification for points and locations.
\item It could represent databases as data points. All data points belonging to a grid square can be cached using the related geohash value.
\item For finding the nearest neighbor, an index on geohash which sorts them alphanumerically, returns the result directly, as the closest string is the nearest point. However, here we could spot a problem with finding nearest neighbors which will be discussed in the followings.
\end{itemize}

Using geohash as a structure for storing, the data structure in database has some advantages based on the above-mention properties. It saves the resources due to storing the two values of longitude and latitude in a single string value without any space and punctuation signs. 
In addition, having geohashes as strings is an important issue which some of the advantages are as follows, 
\begin{itemize}
\item the length of the string correlates to its precision,
\item strings can be grouped by prefix
\item  they are easier to store in databases
\item  they are faster to query. 
\end{itemize}
On the other hand, the indexed data with geohash are positioned in adjacent quadrants and consequently the queries will be faster when tracking them down with the single index than multiple-index on longitude/latitude values. This index can be used in quick proximity searches which do not have to be precise.

Geohash algorithm has a shortcoming when attempts to find the near points based on the common geohash prefix. When points are close but located on opposite sides of a common boundary of two quadrants, they have not only distinct prefixes but wildly distinct geohashes, such as points located on the other sides of the Equator or a meridian. This would cause inefficient proximity searches. To solve this problem, the geohash of the eight surrounding quadrants must be calculated to find the matching locations residing on both sides of boundaries. 
Another problem comes from the projection-based model of the geohashing. This means a geoashe of a specified prefix length will represent the areas with big difference in size near the pole than near the Equator. 
Rogers~\cite{www/geohash-limit} discusses the limitations of geohashing and possible design aspects to improve the efficiency.
% Depending on how you use geohashes, this skews the apparent data distribution in a way that might have to be accounted for in software design. Technically it is possible to design a geohash-like algorithm that does not have this problem. (http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-limitations-of-geohashing)

%Geohashing allows for arbitrary precision. You can geohash a quadrant and then search for all points within the hashed quadrant. If my reading is correct this should return a hash table in constant time [O(1)]. Indexing a map is inflexible. If you want to search a subspace of a quadrant or parts of two adjacent quadrants, you'll have to search all your data again unless you've sorted the data in each quadrant which would be linear time [O(n)].



%http://www.slideshare.net/nknize/rtree-spatial-indexing-with-mongodb-mongodc
%http://www.mongodb.com/presentations/webinar-compliance-and-data-protection-big-data-age-mongodb-security-architecture
%http://docs.mongodb.org/master/MongoDB-indexes-guide.pdf
Using the geohash values, MongoDB provides two special indexes, \textit{2d index} for planar geometries with legacy coordinate pairs and related calculations and \textit{2dsphere index} for spherical calculations. The 2d index is required when we need an index structure for the flat data and 
2dsphere index must be chosen for the spherical data expressed in GeoJSON, since the distance function differs respectively.

To define the 2d index, geohash values are generated for legacy coordinate pairs and the geohash values are indexed using B-Tree instead of the coordinate pairs. 
%Geohash is calculated by recursively dividing the 2D map into quadrants 
%and assigning each area a $2$-bit value, as shown in Figure~\ref{figmongoindex}. 
%Later on geohash values will be indexed using B-Tree to develop the geospatial indexing. 
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{MongoIndex}
\caption{Representation of geohash values for eight quadrants}
\label{figmongoindex}
\end{figure}
MongoDB also provide another 2d index optimized, called Haystack index, to return the results in small areas and is not supported by spherical query operations. To use haystack index in queries, \textit{\$geoSearch} command should be used. Actually, the ways which 2d and 2dsphere index could be applied, cannot access sometimes these small areas. MongoDB also uses B-Tree structure for other type of index, such as Single Field (e.g. indexing over names), Compound, and Text Index. 
%(Probably this point effect on the structure of geospatial index.)

MongoDB supports the following general operations to be executed with geospatial indexes through the mentioned operator:
\begin{itemize}
\item Inclusion: for locations contained entirely within a specified polygon which uses the \textit{\$geoWithin} function.
\item Intersection: for locations that cross or intersects with a geometry using the
\textit{\$geoIntersects} function.
\item Proximity: for locations that are near to a specified point by the \textit{\$near}
function. 
\end{itemize}
The way that the index structure should be applied varies in different queries. For instance, the geoNear command expects the collection to have at most only one 2d index and/or only one 2dsphere. The limitation have to be considered while using the operations or commands.

\subsubsection{MarkLogic Server 7}
Geospatial data in MarkLogic is encoded as XML elements and/or attributes in different representations. MarkLogic handles the geospatial data in GML, KML, GeoRss, WKT and even a general format for geometric data which are not based on a specified format as explained in~\cite{marklogicGeo}. Similar to MongoDB, WGS84 and the raw coordinate systems are supported for geospatial data. WGS84 is used for data on the Earth and the raw coordinate system is suitable for the data on the flat plane.

Regarding the geospatial queries, the following types are supported,
\begin{itemize}
\item Point query: Queries matching a single point.
\item Box query: Queries searching for any point within a rectangular box.
\item Radius query: Queries searching for any point within a specified distance around a point.
\item Polygon query: Queries finding any point within a specified n-sided polygon.
\end{itemize}
To do the geospatial queries, numerous geospatial query constructors exist as well as geospatial operators as built-in functions to perform the operations.
Here, some of these operators are listed,
\begin{itemize}
\item box-intersects: Returns true if the box intersects with the given region.
\item circle-intersects: Returns true if the circle intersects with the given region.
\item polygon-intersects: Returns true if the polygon intersects with the specified region.
\item complex-polygon-intersects: Returns true if the complex-polygon intersects with the given region. A complex polygon is a polygon which is not convex or concave.
\item polygon-contains: Returns true if the polygon contains the defined region.
\item complex-polygon-contains: Returns true if the complex-polygon contains the given region.
\item distance: Returns the distance (in miles) between two points.
\item shortest-distance: Returns the great circle distance between a point and an region. 
\item destination: Returns the point at the given distance along the given direction from the starting point.
\end{itemize}
The region in these operations is a circle, box, polygon, linestring, or complex-polygon 
which is defined by a \textit{region} constructor.
The geospatial query constructors build the queries on the geospatial data. 
Depending on the use case, the relevant constructors and functions from the correspondent namespace should be applied. For instance, if we want to query data expressed in both GML and KML, the \textit{geo} namespace functions are the best choice since they support the queries in all supported geospatial formats.
Also for data in geoRSS, the functions in \textit{georss} namespace could be used. 
This concept is shown in Code~\ref{marklogic-region} which searches for the points inside the specified region. 
\vspace{10px}
\begin{fakeXML}[escapechar=\%,label=marklogic-region,caption=A query example in MarkLogic]
...
xdmp:document-insert("/points.xml",
<root xmlns:geo="http://marklogic.com/geospatial">
  <item><gml:Point><gml:pos>10.5 30.0</gml:pos></gml:Point></item>
  <item><georss:point>15.35 35.34</georss:point></item>
  <item><Dot Latitude="5.11" Longitude="40.55"/></item>
</root> );
 ...
cts:search(doc("/points.xml")//item, 
 geo:geospatial-query(
   geo:box(
     <gml:Envelope>
       <gml:lowerCorner>10.0 35.0</gml:lowerCorner>
       <gml:upperCorner>20.0 40.0</gml:upperCorner>
     </gml:Envelope>)
 ))
 
 %\colorbox{light-gray}{Result}% : <item><georss:point>15.35 35.34</georss:point></item>
 \end{fakeXML}
\vspace{10px}
Another example represented in Code~\ref{marklogic-path} shows how MarkLogic returns the 
points in a given path which lie inside the defined region.
\vspace{10px}
\begin{fakeXML}[escapechar=\%,label=marklogic-path,caption=Another query example in MarkLogic]
cts:search(doc("/points.xml")//item,
  cts:path-geospatial-query("/root/item/point", 
  			cts:box(10.0, 35.0, 20.0, 40.0)))
\end{fakeXML}
\vspace{10px}

Primitive types are another fact in the geospatial queries which might be needed in query conditions 
as shown in the previous Codes~\ref{marklogic-region} and \ref{marklogic-path} using the \textit{box} constructor. These types as instancs of the base type \textit{region}, encompassing \textit{box}, \textit{circle}, \textit{complex-polygon}, \textit{linestring}, \textit{point}, and \textit{polygon}. For instance, the contents of the polygon element in the document "zip.xml" can be cast to a \textit{cts:polygon} using the \textit{cts:polygon} constructor as in the following,
\vspace{10px}
\begin{fakeJSON}
cts:polygon(fn:data(fn:doc("zip.xml")//polygon[@id eq "712"]))
\end{fakeJSON}
\vspace{10px}
%Latitudes and longitude pairs shape points. Points shape other geometries, such as circle or polygon. Boxes are formed by 4 points which on the surface of the Earth. The edges of the box are arcs, but when those arcs are projected into a plane, they become two-dimensional latitude and longitude lines, and the space defined by those lines forms a rectangle. A linestring is a sequence of connected joined arcs that do not necessarily form a closed loop. 

Marklogic also provides functions to handle the WKT datatype. The function \textit{parse-wkt} reads WKT into the \textit{region} items as the following example returns a polygon.
\vspace{10px}
\begin{fakeJSON}
cts:parse-wkt("POINT(10 10)")
\end{fakeJSON}
\vspace{10px}
This point can be used in queries as any other type. Conversly the function \textit{to-wkt} converts \textit{region} type to WKT.


\textbf{The Geospatial Index.}
Geospatial index in MarkLogic is not based on neither the quad tree nor R-tree. It works similar to a range index with points as data values. In this range index, every value is a pair of latitude (lat) and longitude (long). Like an array of x,y values, sorted mainly based on latitude and then longitude values. The values in this array are also connected to the corresponding document.
The points would be founded easily in a sorted structure. 
Boxes could be found first by finding the latitude range, then checking for the longitude range. 
For circles and polygons as well as more complex types, the geometry's bounding box is used to find the region they belong to. 
Also, to check whether a point is inside the polygon, the number of intersections with the northward or southward arc of the point is counted.
\vspace{10px}
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l |l |}\hline
\textbf{Data} & \textbf{Path}\\\hline
\begin{fakeJSON}
<a:geo>
  <a:location>37 -122</a:location>
</a:geo>
\end{fakeJSON} &
\begin{fakeJSON}
/a:geo/a:location
\end{fakeJSON}\\\hline
\begin{fakeJSON}
<a:geo>
  <a:location data:"37 -122/>
</a:geo>
\end{fakeJSON} &
\begin{fakeJSON}
/a:geo/a:location/@data
\end{fakeJSON}
\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Data and the related path for indexing in MarkLogic}
\label{t.pathindexmarklogic}
\end{table}
\vspace{10px}
Based on this structure, Marklogic supports the following geospatial indexes,
\begin{itemize}
\item Geospatial Element Indexes: With this index, the data is represented by whitespace or punctuation separated element content. The lat-long or long-lat point formats could represent a point. Other entries such as z-coordinate or altitudes will be omitted.
\item Geospatial Element Child Indexes: With this index, the data comes only from the elements that are a specific child of a specific element containing whitespace or punctuation separated content.
\item Geospatial Element Pair Indexes: In this index, the data is considered from specific pair of elements that are a child of another specific element.
\item Geospatial Attribute Pair Indexes: With this index, the data is involved in a pair of specific attributes of a particular element.
\item Geospatial Path Range Indexes: With this index, the data is expressed in the same manner as a geospatial element index and the element or attribute index is defined by a path expression. Table~\ref{t.pathindexmarklogic} shows two examples of the data as an element and attribute and related paths for indexing each one. It should be mentioned that a defined path cannot be replaced with a new one unless it is removed.
\end{itemize}

To speed up the retrieval of geospatial values geospatial indexes enable geospatial lexicon lookups. Since these functions are implemented using geospatial indexes, the appropriate index must be created in order to use a geospatial lexicon. As an example, a geospatial element index is needed to use the \textit{element-geospatial-boxes}. Here is a sample to show how these functions are used and returns values from the specified element geospatial value lexicon that match the specified wildcard pattern.
\vspace{10px}
\begin{fakeJSON}[escapechar=\!]

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For querying on geospatial data in MarkLogic, after loading the data into the database and making the indexes, primitive types should be constructed to be used in query functions. Then, geospatial queries are constructed using these primitive types. 

\subsubsection{eXist-db}
%Here, we briefly describe the concepts of geospatial support in eXist-db\footnote{The spatial module in eXist-db is still in experimental satus.} to see the properties and implementation model of the functions and the index structure. 

The database eXist-db~\cite{existdb} version $1.2$\footnote{The spatial module in eXist-db is still in experimental status.} supports geospatial data in GML $2.1.2$ format. The geospatial features are provided using the JTS API in geospatial computations. 
The general development idea of indexing in eXist-db follows a modular architecture.
The geospatial index is developed based on this model and maintained as a pluggable extension. 
%To create the geospatial index, it must be configured in collection-specific configuration XML files that are located in the system collection: "/db/system/config". 
The geospatial index in eXist-db is made by a relational database to index spatial data. The index doesn't store character data from the document. It stores WKB index entries through the JDBC in  the HSQLDB which could be any other relational database such as PostGIS. The index creation relies on the open source libraries of the GeoTools~\cite{geotools} project. Geometries are stored both in the original coordinate system and WGS84 system in index structure to allow the operations on data originated from the different systems. In this way, transformations between coordinate systems are included using GeoTools library.
 
%In other words, the spatial data is stored in the DB, but geometries, as JTS Geometry instances, are held in memory, waiting for a special mode to be flushed into a relational DB, insertion or removal. The Geometry WKT representation would be serialized and deserialized to and from the database.

\subsubsection{MonetDB}
MonetDB\footnote{This information which are presented here, are from January 2014 Bugfix.} basically is a relational column-store database which has implemented a separate module to support the objects and functions in the OGC "Simple Features Specification for SQL"~\cite{ogcsfs}. MonetDB stores XML in its relational architecture as Boncz et al~\cite{Boncz2006} describes. The geospatial component in MonetDB wraps the open source GEOS libraries~\cite{GEOS}
which is the \textit{C++} implementation of the JTS API. MonetDB supports the OGC geospatial types in WKT. Numerous functions exist in MonetDB to provide SQL-based geospatial querying. 

As Vermeij et al~\cite{MonetDB} discusses, MonetDB benefits from the design principles for spatial query processing in three main areas. First, the column-based storage approach keeps the non-needed geometry out of the way since the traditional tuple-based storage model stores the whole tuple physically together on a disk block. Additionally, some efficient filtering stored in the same column and some approximate geometries, e.g. minimum bounding box, maximum enclosed circle, and maximum enclosed rectangle stored in other related tables would speed up the queries as the index structure does. Second, MonetDB query optimizer effectively improves the geospatial query performance. Third, the spatial data types integration with XML types in MonetDB is considered as an efficient way of querying. 
%Even though MonetDB still does not provide any indexing structure, ....
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The column-store approach of MonetDB is advantagous for geospatial data, since skips the unnecessary %attributes. This becomes important as only a fraction of data is needed in most of 
%\end{itemize}

\subsection{Other Related Topics}

In addition to the forementioned topics, some other areas have been discovered as well in this research line. 
we briefly discuss here two ideas which might be advantageous 
for more geospatial features and processing in a geospatial database.
The first idea, presented in the first paragraph, is about the unification of the coordinate system when the data
is coming from different sources.  The second idea, presented in the second paragraph, is pointing to a 
completely different idea of finding a path between to points in these database.

Schwarz et al\cite{Schwarz2004} introduced a library for geospatial data management to enable handling the different coordinate systems. This library provides geospatial functions which are delegated to JTS library. As mentioned before, JTS library only supports the Cartesian coordinate system and the input geometries should be in a common systems to be processed. It can happen that the geometries have different coordinate systems. For example, the geospatial data is provided from different sources. In order to work with JTS library, a common coordinate system is chosen to which other systems of the current data are converted. This coordinate system is chosen considering the the transformation issues to have the minimum differences from the original data and to maximize the transformations precision.


Padmaja et al~\cite{short-path} introduces an alternative way of finding the shortest path regarding existing cost. The k-shortest path and many other path finding algorithms are efficient as long as the effecting cost factors do not change dynamically. This provided method first finds the shortest paths without considering the cost factors. At the end, the factors are used to rank the paths. All paths between each two points could be stored in database in pre-processing stage to reduce the further combinations. To find the paths, each edge in the network of the connected points should be provided with the start and end points. The process starts from the starting point and finds the whole connected ones and continues till reaches the destination. The paths would be obtained by joining the edges detected in each step.

\section{Spatial Querying in BaseX}
\label{s.basex}

%TODO: and  http://spatialnews.geocomm.com/features/gml/topten.html
Spatial query is a special type of query which requires the processing of geometries with two certain properties in general. First, it has geometries as inputs and outputs as well as other primitive types, like double, integer, etc. Second, it considers spatial relations between the geometries.
As we discussed in Section~\ref{s.dbs}, there are various viewpoints in providing geospatial features in a database to fulfill the expected requirements. Following the OGC Simple Feature (OGCSF)~\cite{springergeo} data model, geospatial features in BaseX adapt the EXPath geospatial API function interface specification which defines commonly used functions from the OGCSF Common Access API \cite{simpleFeature}. Since the OCGSF data model is typically represented in GML, we concentrate to add the support of GML format in BaseX. However, an implementation could support other encodings, like KML. 

Throughout the following sections, we discuss the integration of geospatial data processing in BaseX. We introduce geospatial functions as a new module, called \textit{Geo Module}, in Section~\ref{geomodule}. Query efficiency is improved later in Section~\ref{indexBX} by implementing an index structure. Indexing and the related time complexities are discussed hereafter in Section~\ref{indexFunc} and Section~\ref{BXevaluation}, as the critical issue in this topic. Finally the concluding is explained in Section~\ref{BXconc}.

\subsection{Geo Module}
\label{geomodule}
As mentioned above, geospatial features in BaseX are implemented based on the EXPath Geo Module Specification \cite{expath}. This specification contains the definition of functions for widely used geographic and geometric analysis operations, from OGCSF Common Access API version 1.2. These functions apply to geometries in different formats, such as GML, KML, GeoJSON, Well Known Text (WKT), and even Well Known Binary (WKB). Based on the specification, Geo Module in BaseX comprises a set of functions, such as intersection, within, distance, boundary, centroid, diference, union, and etc., added to the \textit{basex-api} package. The geometries supported in this module are Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString, and MultiPolygon. This module is an individual package with a set of classes as briefly described below,
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Geo}: This class is the main class, in which all geo spatial functions are defined. The set of functions in this class include those which are used in XQuery. The complete list of functions and their description are available in the online BaseX documentation.
\item \textit{GeoError}: This class defines error functions with related massages which are thrown when an error occurs.
\item \textit{GeoTest}: Test functions for the \textit{Geo} class are implemented here.
\item \textit{GmlReader}: Functions required to parse GML geometries as XML elements, are implemented in this class.
\item \textit{GeoIndex}: Besides, this class implements the functions related to the geospatial index. 
\end{itemize}

Geospatial index structure is implemented in BaseX core. Spatial indexing and related implementation details will be described in Section~\ref{indexBX}. Here, we explain general functionalities of this module.

The geospatial functions are defined as public methods in the \textit{Geo} class. They use some private methods to read geometries or write them out into the GUI. Besides, each function employs the corresponding function from the JTS library to do the required geometric operation and to provide the appropriate result. Here, we shortly explain the process by which the input geometries, either from a variable or a database node, are processed.


Suppose we are searching for all geometries within a specified polygon ($\$p$). The query should be written using XQuery via BaseX GUI as follows,
\vspace{10px}
\begin{fakeJSON}
let $p := 
<gml:Polygon>
  <gml:outerBoundaryIs> ... </gml:outerBoundaryIs>
</gml:Polygon>
for $x in //gml:Polygon
  return if ( within($x, $p) ) then $x else ()
\end{fakeJSON}
\vspace{10px}
Each geospatial function has at least one geometry as input, as in the above \textit{within} function. In this example, the $\$p$ variable is provided as a docment node and the $\$x$ variable iterates all Polygon nodes in the current database. Various function are involved in processing this query. Followings, this process which is illustrated in Figure~\ref{figGeoModuleProcess} is explained in detail. 

To read the geometries as a document node, the private function \textit{geo} makes sure that the node name is at least a valid geometry name. It means if the element name is something out of the set of geometry names, the function will throw an error. 
Then, the GmlReader class is used to read and parse the whole element and to check the validity based on GML 2.0 format. Regarding the JTS limitation, geometries have to be in GML 2.0 format to be validated and analyzed for further operations. 

The forementioned GmlReader class reads the elements differently based on their types, i.e., tag names. If the element is a valid GML geometry, the function creates the corresponding geometry, using JTS constructors. Otherwise, the matching error massage will be shown. For instance, if a polygon does not have any outer ring or if the coordinates of a ring do not shape a closed ring, an error will be thrown. 

 \begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{GeoModuleProcess}
\caption{Converting GML elements to geometries}
\label{figGeoModuleProcess}
\end{figure}

Now, the geometries are ready to be processed in a geometric operation, like checking two geometries whether they intersect each other, finding the symmetric distance of two geometries, or getting the number of inner rings of a polygon. The operations are done using the JTS functions. The output could be in any XML Schema (XSD) data types, such as integer, boolean, string, URI, and etc., or GML 2.0 Geometry. The XSD type are equivalent to the BaseX defined data types. That means primitve data types like boolean, integer, and string are represented in BaseX as \textit{Bln}, \textit{Str}, and \textit{Int} classes respectively. The Geometry type, which can be the output of functions like the intersection, union, and difference of two geometries, must be returned as an element in the abstract node (\textit{ANode}) type to be in compliance with the specification. Having the output geometries in GML format, GMLWriter function converts them first to a string, using JTS GmlWriter and builds a database node (DBNode) hereafter. Considering the point that DBNode extends the ANode class, the output node is sent to the GUI and is shown as a gml element, expressing the geometric result. 

Although the geo functions are working, the query performance seems not satisfying. Having commonly huge geospatial data, we encounter serious performance problems. The common solution is an indexing algorithm designed to improve efficiency. Since the geospatial data is a written form of geometries positioned in the space, an indexing structure can be designed considering the positions. In the following sections, we discuss an indexing approach and its influence on performance compared with the querying without using any geospatial index.


\subsection{Geospatial Index in BaseX}
\label{indexBX}
To enhance the geospatial query time in BaseX, we discuss an index structure. This index avoids processing the whole database when partial checking of the file would be enough. For this purpose, a bounding box is computed for each geometry by which an efficient filtering can be applied. For example, if we want to find the objects within a specific geometry, examining just the area near to this geometry is adequate. If two geometries have intersecting bounding boxes, they might intersect each other and have to be checked weather they fulfill the query condition. Otherwise, they will not have any contact and there is no need to check them. This approach decreases the number of scanned geometries and consequently gives the better timing, which we call it two step filtering. The two step filtering is clarified as followings,
\begin{enumerate}
\item Finding the geometries which their bounding box intersect with the bounding box of query area
\item Checking the selected geometries against the query condition
\end{enumerate}
%Moreover, functions of this module in which a big number of geometries from the database coule be involved, have the time complexity bigger than O(1) and need a spatial indexing to be handled in shorter time. %TODO conintinue


 \begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{IndexinFile}
\caption{Geospatial index creation}
\label{figIndexinFile}
\end{figure}

Among the spatial index structures discussed in Section~\ref{geospatialindex}, JTS supports the STR-tree and Quad-tree. Davis~\cite{jts-presentation} discussed that STR-tree in contrast with Quad-tree can not be updated after the generation. However, we choose the STR-tree since it has better performance. As mentioned before, STR-tree has the basic of R-Tree with the improved performance. The index tree structure, holding the bounding boxes in inner nodes and geometries in leaves, is made once when the spatial index for the database is requested and written into a file on disk. This process is illustrated in Figure~\ref{figIndexinFile}. Each time the index is requested, the file is read 
into main memory and it will be kept there for the future requests.
Then, the two step filltering is executed. 
It should be mentioned that only the following queries would benefit from this index. The definitions of these functions are provided in EXPath Geo Module specification.
\begin{itemize}
\item intersects (geometry1, geometry2)
\item within (geometry1, geometry2)
\item contains (geometry1, geometry2)
\item overlaps (geometry1, geometry2)
\item crosses (geometry1, geometry2)
\item touches (geometry1, geometry2)
\end{itemize}

The spatial index structure is involved both in BaseX core and \textit{basex-api} packages. The main structure of the index is added as a package in core, called \textit{index.spatial}. This package contains the index builder classes based on the core index structure of BaseX. The class \textit{SpatialBuilder} which extends \textit{IndexBuilder}, builds the index tree using pre-values instead of the tag names to address the database elements. Then, JTS serializer writes the tree structure into a file called \textit{STR-treeIndex}.

The other GeoIndex class in \textit{basex-api} package extends \textit{QueryModule} class and implements the method defined by JTS STR-tree class for reading the index file from hard disk into memory. Additionally, this class implements the \textit{filter} method to do the first step of two step filtering. The datails of the index implementation is described in the following section.
 
\subsection{Index Functions Implementation}
\label{indexFunc}
To add the spatial index, we tought of two approaches. The first approach implements new signature for the forementioned functions in a new class. It means the index filter function is encoded directly in the existing geo functions. Then queries can be done with the new spatial function as in Code~\ref{intersectIndx}.
\vspace{10px}
\begin{fakeXML}[label=intersectIndx,caption=The geo function containing the index functions]
import module namespace geo-index = "http://expath.org/ns/GeoIndex";
let $a:= <gml:Polygon> ... </gml:Polygon>
return geo-index:intersects("DB", $a) 
\end{fakeXML}

\vspace{10px}
\begin{fakeXML}[label=geoandfilter,caption=Geo function used with index function]
import module namespace geo-index = "http://expath.org/ns/GeoIndex";
import module namespace geo = "http://expath.org/ns/Geo";
declare namespace gml="http://www.opengis.net/gml";
let $a:= <gml:Polygon>
                <gml:outerBoundaryIs>
                  <gml:LinearRing>
              	    <gml:coordinates>
              	      3.9,50.6 6,52.8 4.5,52.8 3.9,50.6
              	    </gml:coordinates>
                  </gml:LinearRing>
                </gml:outerBoundaryIs>
             </gml:Polygon>
return ( geo-index:filter("DB", $a)[geo:intersects( $a, .)])
\end{fakeXML}
\vspace{10px}

Since having two functions with the same name and functionality is redundant, we introduce a new approach in which the \textit{filter} function can be used in XQuery to benefit from the index stucture. In this way, a sample query would be as in Code~\ref{geoandfilter}. To summarize these approaches, the former approach as in Code~\ref{intersectIndx}, does the whole process including the first step of filtering through the \textit{geo-index:intersects} function, while the latter approach as in Code~\ref{geoandfilter}, uses the original \textit{geo:intersects} function together with \textit{geo-index:filter} which does the first step of filtering. 


The negative point about the latter approach is that the input polygon, like polygon $\$a$ in Code~\ref{geoandfilter}, is read, parsed, and created every time that the spatial function, here \textit{intersects}, is called in the \textit{for} loop, evevn though it is the same fixed object. Since, this causes redundancy and consumes a considerable amount of time, we use a map to hash the fixed input and prevet the further redundant reading. This will dramatically reduce the query time, as shown in Figure~\ref{figMap}.
 \begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{MapIndexing}
\caption{Using a Map to cache the input geometry: performance effect}
\label{figMap}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{figMap} demonstrates the time consumed by different queries to read the single input geometry with or without caching. It could be seen that when no map is used, as the number of results goes higher more time is taken, while by caching the time consumption remains constant, since the input geometry is read once. In other words, the input geometry will be read each time the function \textit{geo:intersects} is called without caching, as it is one of the input arguments. In the next section, we assess the performance isues related to the geospaial index.

\subsection{Evaluation and Improvement}
\label{BXevaluation}
%TODO:jomle aval beravad b sectione ghabl
There is no need to emphasize on the importance of the role that indexing plays in the query time and the performance improvement. Here, we use real-world data to observe the effect of the currently implemented spatial index, followed by in depth looking at the implementation from other perspectives. The aim is to find ways in order to improve performance. This data is provided by University of Twente, Department of Geoinformation Processing and holds some real information on the Earth in GML 2.0 format. The original file is based on one of the Netherlands coordinate system (RD/NAP Amersfoort RD New) and is around $133.3$ MB including the $12773$ polygons inside the $11886$ multipolygons.
We run different queries on this database with and without geospatial index to see time consumption dependency on the index structure. 
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{IndexEfficiency}
\caption{Query performance improvement by using geospatial index}
\label{figIndexEfficiency}
\end{figure}

Since queries have various number of results, we can see the trend changes in regards to the number of outputs.
To start with, we take a look at the effect on index utilization in queries in comparison with queries using no spatial index. Figure~\ref{figIndexEfficiency} represents the effectiveness of index utilization.
As shown in Figure~\ref{figIndexEfficiency}, when geospatial index is not used, the query time remains constant for every query regardless of the number of results. As we discussed in Section~\ref{indexBX}, this is because of the fact that for each query, the whole file is scanned and analyzed. In contrast, queries using geospatial index relatively take more time as the number of output objects goes higher. It confirms that filtering approach are going in the right direction, but the performance still is not satisfying. Thus, we need to investigate more ways to improve it.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{JTSReadetTimeConsumption}
\caption{JTSReader time consumpion in total query ime}
\label{figJTSReaderTime}
\end{figure}
By monitoring the times consumed by different part of a query, we discovered that JTS GMLReader functions takes considerable amount of time (see Figure~\ref{figJTSReaderTime}). This time is taken by \textit{JTS GMLReader} class by which the geometries are read from GML and converted to \textit{JTS} geometries. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\subfigure[Through JTS GMLReader]{
	\includegraphics[width=0.47\textwidth]{GmlReaderProcess1.png}
	\label{figParseProcess1}
}
\centering
\subfigure[Through Custom GML Reader]{
	\includegraphics[width=0.47\textwidth]{GmlReaderProcess.png}
	\label{figParseProcess2}
	
}
\caption{Parsing process of the GML elements}
\label{figParseProcess}
\end{figure}

Regarding the geometry reading process by JTS, shown in Figure~\ref{figParseProcess1}, it seems that the direct parsing approach might decline the query time. Thus, we implement a custome GML reader class to immediately parse the GML elements into the JTS geometries (see Figure~\ref{figParseProcess2}). To assess the time efficiency, a set of queries are tested and the results are presented in Figure~\ref{figGmlReader}. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{GmlReader}
\caption{Custom GMLReader vs. JTS GMLReaer}
\label{figGmlReader}
\end{figure}

As it was supposed, reading time drastically reduced by using the new reader functions, although both have increasing trend proportional to the number of outputs.%gosaste

A deeper look at the different parts of a query will be beneficial to find the parts where need to be concentrated more in order to achieve better performance. Suppose we run the query below,
\vspace{10px}
\begin{fakeJSON}
let $a:= <gml:Polygon> ... </gml:Polygon>
return ( geo-index:filter("DB", $a) [geo:intersects( . , $a)]).
\end{fakeJSON}
\vspace{10px}
The total query time will be divided into the following parts,

\begin{enumerate}
\item reading the input geometry \textit{\$a}
\item filtering the geometries using \textit{filter} function by pre values 
\item reading the filtered geometries from the database using selected pre values
\item apply \textit{intersects} operation on the pair of input geometry and each selected geometries.
\end{enumerate}

To see how each part influence the performance, we examine them separately. Figure~\ref{figDetailedTiming} shows the times taken by the above-mentioned actions. It could be seen that the biggest amount of time is spended reading the geometries. Even the single reading of the input geometry seems to be expensive. Hence, the reading function should be observed more in detail.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth,height=0.25\textheight]{detailedTiming}
\caption{Detailed timing in a query using geospatial index}
\label{figDetailedTiming}
\end{figure}


We have used Java profiling to get more precise information. The first few methods in profile output with the highest percentage of time occupation, ordered from the most-used to the least-used, are listed in the following,

\vspace{10px}
\begin{tabular}{l l l c l}
\textbf{rank} & \textbf{self} & \textbf{accum} & \textbf{count} & \textbf{method} \\
 & & & &\\
1 & 6.95\% & 6.95\% & 94 & org.basex.util.Token.{\color{red}split}\\
2 & 5.33\% & 12.28\% & 72 & org.expath.ns.GmlReader.createPolygon \\
3 & 4.59\% & 16.86\% & 62 & org.basex.util.Token.{\color{red}split} \\
4 & 4.22\% & 21.08\% & 57 & org.basex.query.func.JavaModuleFunc.eval \\
5 & 3.55\% & 24.63\% & 48 & org.expath.ns.Geo.geo \\
6 & 3.18\% & 27.81\% & 43 & org.basex.util.Token.{\color{red}split} \\
7 & 3.03\% & 30.84\% & 41 & org.basex.util.Token.{\color{red}split} \\
8 & 2.96\% & 33.80\% & 40 & org.basex.util.Token.{\color{red}split} \\
9 & 2.74\% & 36.54\% & 37 & org.expath.ns.Geo.geo \\
\end{tabular}
\vspace{10px}

As the profile output indicates, the \textit{split} function calls consume the greatest amount of time. Besides, \textit{createPolygon} and \textit{geo} functions, all used in \textit{GmlReader} class, are expensive. Therefore, these functions should be focused in performance tuning. 
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth,height=0.2\textheight]{BXSplit}
\caption{The query times of the selected queries before and after the removing of \textit{split} function}
\label{figBXSplit}
\end{figure}
Since the \textit{split} function has the most frequent call, we discard it in favour of better performance. This function is used to divide a "coordinate" string regarding the delimiters to make coordinate pairs. We replaced it with a piece of code to parse this string. 
A "coordinate" value in GML 2.0 can include different points which are separated with a space. Each point in the coordinate of GML 2.0 have two dimensions $X$ and $Y$ seprated with a comma. Code~\ref{coord-example} shows an example of the GML 2.0 coordinate. Based on this format, the new code reads the "coordinate" string and acts based on the position and type of delimiters and numbers. Therefore, the coordinate pairs are constructed from a valid string. Otherwise, an error massage will be shown. Figure~\ref{figBXSplit} shows the effect of removing the \textit{split} function on the query times. As can be seen in this Figure, this effect grows as the number of results gets bigger.
 
\vspace{10px}
\begin{fakeXML}[label=coord-example,caption=An example of GML 2.0 coordinate]
<gml:coordinates>
  3.9,50.6 6,52.8 4.5,52.8 3.9,50.6
</gml:coordinates>
\end{fakeXML}
\vspace{10px}

In addition to the \textit{split} function, we omit the $Z$ values in parsing process, since the $Z$ value is ignored with the geospatial function. It means it is useless to read this $Z$ value. It can be considered as a limitation of GML 2.0 which is improved in GML 3.0. Not surprisingly, excluding the $Z$ values from the parsing process declines the query time that is displayed in Figure~\ref{figBXZvalue}. This effect is minor in the smaller number of results and is more obvious with more output numbers.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth,height=0.2\textheight]{BXZvalue-sec}
\caption{The effect of ignoring the $Z$ values of coordinates in GML parsing on query times}
\label{figBXZvalue}
\end{figure}

Up to this point we have tried various ways to decrease the query times in Geo Module. Further attemps could be done following the feorementioned Java profiling list, if the implementation will be continued in the current direction.

\subsection{Conclusion}
\label{BXconc}
In this Section, we discussed the Geo Module implementation details and assessment in BaseX which provides a set of geometric functions based on the EXPath Geo Module specification. This module employs the JTS library to compute the geometric operations. To enhance the performance, the JTS STR-tree index structure is added that accelerates the execution time of queries such as intersects, within, inside, and touches. This is done by applying a filtering in the STR-tree structure and consequently reducing the number of processes in the database. Besides the index tree, a GML Reader class is developed to parse the gml elements directly regarding the inefficieny in JTS GMLReader. Although the timing results are convincing, there are room for improvements. For example, the function \textit{split}, \textit{geo}, and \textit{createPolygon} can be modifiend in favour of better performance.

\section{BaseX vs MongoDB}
\label{s.mongo}
%TODO:Complete

An introduction of MongoDB geospatial features is provided before in \ref{mongo}. In this section, we will have a more-detailed overview of these functionalities and a comparison between BaseX and MongoDB. However these two systems follow distinct approaches, it would be beneficial to review MongoDB as a rather new, recently developed, and widely used database system. MongoDB is among the few NOSQL systems providing geospatial features. Here, we will mainly see differences between these systems, particularly in performance of the same features. This comparision empowers us to improve the geospatial querying performance in BaseX. 

As we discussed in Section~\ref{mongo}, geospatial data can be represented in MongoDB either as planar or spherical maps. Since the earth is a spherical globe, the geospatial calculations on planar maps are only an approximation~\cite{coordsys,coordsys-mongo}. As an example, the measurement of distances in planar maps are accurate only in a small region. It means the spherical maps are the better representation when the calculations are expected as real ones on the Earth. As our goal is to assess some geospatial features of MongoDB and compare it with Basex Geo Module, we focus merely on the spherical approach. Correspondingly, WGS84 is used instead of legacy coordinate pairs to express the spherical maps.

Geospatial operators of MongoDB for spherical data support the GeoJSON \cite{www/geojson} format. GeoJSON is a human-readable encoding format for representing the geographical features, using JSON standard. It consists of an object which describes a geometry, Feature, or collection of Features. The type of geometries must be one of these types: Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon, and GeometryCollection. A \textit{Feature} must have members with the names \textit{geometry} and \textit{properties}. A feature collection is an object with the type \textit{FeatureCollection} which must have a member with the name \textit{features}. Code~\ref{feature-collection} is an instance GeoJSON file with a \textit{FeatureCollection} object.

Current version of MongoDB supports only three geometry types Point, LineString, and Polygon. As mentioned in Section~\ref{mongo}, a geospatial query in MongoDB can use \textit{geoIntersects}, \textit{geoWithin}, \textit{near}, and \textit{nearSphere} operators. In addition, there are geometry specifiers to define geometries in query conditions of these operators. For instance, the \textit{\$center} and \textit{\$centerSphere} are specifiers for a circle area in planar and spherical maps on which the user intends to do the query. Then, the user can find all geometries within a determined circular area. Another example is the \textit{\$maxDistance} specifier that determines the maxmimum distance from a point in order to find geometries within this particular distance. Geometry specifires are limited to, \textit{\$geometry}, \textit{\$maxDistance}, \textit{\$center}, \textit{\$centerSphere}, \textit{\$box}, and \textit{\$polygon}. An example demonstrating the usage of the specifiers in a query is provided in the followings,
\vspace{10px}
\begin{fakeJSON}
db.<collection>.find( { <location field> :
                         { $geoWithin :
                           { $centerSphere :
                              [ [ <x>, <y> ] , <radius> ] }
                      } } )
\end{fakeJSON}
 \vspace{10px}
 
In the following sections we will compare these two databases regarding the query performance. 
In Section~\ref{s.query}, we analyze specific test queries. Then, the assessment continues
utilizing the indexing structure in Section~\ref{index}. Later, the update functionality of databases is 
investigated in Section~\ref{update}. Finally, Section~\ref{conc} contains the conclusion and further work.

\subsection{Querying the Databases}
\label{s.query}
To analyze and compare the databases behaviour, designing the same test queries on the identical dataset is the most straight-forward approach. Based on the MongoDB geospatial features and properties, the Netherland test dataset must be changed. A brief explanation of the changes is provided here to clarify the rules and limitaions. The main change was to either remove multipolygon from the dataset or transforming them to a set of distinct polygons, since multipolygon is not supported in this version of MongoDB. Besides, the coordinate system is converted to WGS84. At the end, there are 12773 polygons and no multipolygon in the data file. Since the geometries are changed in database and the results would be different, we repeat all queries with the new dataset in BaseX.

To start with, the GeoJSON file containing the geometries, is imported into MongoDB. This can be done  using Java API or Mongo Shell with appropriate \textit{mongoimport} command. There are limitations to consider in importing the GeoJSON in MongoDB. The main one is the \textit{document} size limitation in a \textit{collection}. Document and collection are two concepts in MongoDB which are correspond with a table and a record in this table respectively. A collection can have one or more documents and a document is a set of key-values. A database contains one or more collections. To successfully import a document into a collection, it should be smaller than 16MB. Since it is common to have large geometries in real-world geographic data files, this limitation can be a problem. Aother limitation is that the $z$ coordinate is not supported in MongoDB. When a coordinate contains $z$ dimension, although those geometries are not processed, no error massage is shown during the import process and query. MultiPoint, MultiLineString, and MultiPolygon, which are not supported in MongoDB, are also skipped in queries without any error massage. 

The above-mentioned size limitation made us to change the file structure again.
When the file structure was in the form of Code~\ref{feature-collection}, 
an error message regarding the size limitation was thrown. 
When the GeoJSON file structure is changed to contain individual features as below,
this problem disappeared.

%TODO:explain about the query difficulties and aggregation of the above structure
After importing the file, we examined the common features, i.e., intersection, within, 
functionalities in both databases.
%and near  
The queries in Code~\ref{basex-query} and Code~\ref{mongo-query} find the intersecting geometries from the Netherland's dataset with the given polygon in BaseX and MongoDB. The polygon coordinates are determined for different queries in the following way. At first, the maximum and minimum coordinates are found in the dataset. After that, we generate differet input polygons in regard to these boundaries. The polygons coordinate are altered such that the number of results differes in each query.
\vspace{10px}

                } } } } )
\end{fakeXML}
\vspace{10px}

Similar queries are designed to check the other functions. Here, we skip the queries and directly go to the results. To check the profiling in MongoDB, query plan information, such as the index type, the query time, scanned objects, etc, \textit{\$explain} operator could be specified either in the forms,
\vspace{10px}
\begin{fakeJSON}
db.collection.find()._addSpecial( "$explain", 1 )
db.collection.find( { $query: {}, $explain: 1 } )
\end{fakeJSON}
 or 
 \begin{fakeJSON}
db.collection.find().explain().

Below the profile of a sample query is shown,
\vspace{10px}
\begin{fakeJSON}
"cursor" : "BasicCursor",
"isMultiKey" : false,

"nscanned" : 12773,

"millis" : 43907,

\end{fakeJSON}
\vspace{10px}

In the provided information, number of the results and the query time is implied in \textit{n} and \textit{millis} elements respectively. \textit{cursor} specifies the type of the cursor used by the operation. Here, \textit{BasicCursor} indicates that the query is merely performing a normal scan to find the results.  This typical cursor reads the documents in natural order. That is, no index is used for this operation and the whole data is scanned in the original order. If a geospatial index is used, the cursor type will change. The value\textit{n} reflects the number of geometries that match the query condition, i.e., the number of items on the cursor. \textit{nscanned} is the number of scanned documents for this operation, when no index is used, or scanned index entry in the range, when an index is used. \textit{nscannedObjects} is the number of scanned documents in this query to obtain the results. In queries which an index structure is not used, as in the above sample, these two numbers will be equal. Otherwise, \textit{nscannedObjects} may be lower, as shown in the following query plan which uses a geospatial index. 
In other words, $nscanned\geq nscannedObjects\geq n$ always. Ofcourse, the most optimum state is where $nscanned=nscannedObjects=n$. 
\vspace{10px}

Running the same queries as before, like \textit{intersects}, in both databases, Figure~\ref{figBXvsMongoNoIndexIntersects} shows the timing of various queries without using any geospatial index. As it could be seen, all query times are more or less the same, since the whole data is scanned when no index is used. It is also obvious from the following query plan in MongoDB which specifies the cursor type, number of index keys scanned (nscsnned), and number of documents scanned to get the result (nscsnnedObjects),
\begin{fakeJSON}
...
"n" : 12773,
"nscannedObjects" : 12773,
"nscanned" : 12773,
...
\end{fakeJSON}

\end{figure}


Until now, the sample queries are applied to the databases without using any index. 
In the following section, we measure the running time again by applying the geospatial index.
In this way, we also cover \textit{near} and \textit{nearSphere} queries in MongoDB that definately need the geospatial index.  
%using the \textit{distance} function to find the near geometries in BaseX in which the current index structure is not applicable.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%% Section: Indexing in the Databases
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Indexing in the Databases}
\label{index}
The assessment process is continued by applying the geospatial index. In MongoDB there are two choices for using geospatial index, \textit{2d} for data expressed in legacy coordinate pairs and \textit{2dsphere} for both GeoJSON data objects and legacy coordinate pairs. We use \textit{2dsphere} which fits to the choice of sherical maps, via the following shell command,
\vspace{10px}
\begin{fakeJSON}
db.Collection.ensureIndex({geometry:"2dsphere"}) 
\end{fakeJSON}
\vspace{10px}
The same step is also taken in BaseX. Running again the same queries using a geospatial index, supposedly gives declined query times (see Figure~\ref{figBXvsMongoIndexIntersects}). As explained in Section~\ref{s.basex}, index is apllied through the \textit{filter} function in BaseX, while MongoDB follows another approach. MongoDB applies the index in casual query formats after executing the above-mentioned command and there is no need to change the queries in general. 


\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{BXvsMongo-Intersects-Index-Sec-log}
\caption{Query timing of \textit{intersect} operation with geospatial index}
\label{figBXvsMongoIndexIntersects}
\end{figure}

%Besides, the search for the geometries within an input area is done in the same way and the timings are shown in Figure~\ref{figBXvsMongoIndexWithin}. It can be seen that the queries with smaller number ofreturned geometries have better performane in MongoDB. Although it seems a positive point to return the big numbers of result in as shorter time as possible, considering smaller returned numbers of results is of greate importance for us, since these queries are more common in real-world usecases.

The next widely used type of query is finding the near places or geometries up to a distance from a specific point. It could be also expressed as finding the geometries inside a circle with the distance value as the radius lenght. This feature is provided in MongoDB via \textit{\$near} and \textit{\$nearSphere} operators which simply get the reference point and the disance and hereafter returns the whole geometries in the specified distance from the point. Both near operators need a geospatial index, either \textit{2d} or \textit{2dsphere}. A specific distance in meter is defined as a condition to filter those geometries within this area. Below, we provide a sample query of the \textit{\$nearSphere} oprator.  
\vspace{10px}
\begin{fakeJSON}
db.collection.find({{geometry:
                       {$nearSphere:
                         {$geometry:
                           {type:"Point", coordinates:[4.5,51.95]}, 
                             $maxDistance : 100
                    }}}})
\end{fakeJSON}
\vspace{10px}
%TODO:reference for projected coordinate sys.
BaseX Geo Module currently provides this feature via \textit{distance} or combination of \textit{buffer} and \textit{within} functions. In Both cases, if the coordinate system in which the data is provided is a projected coordinate system, the distance can be specified in meter or any other metric unit. In a projected coordinate system, all the areas, lengths, and angels are defined on a flat two-dimensional space. In such a system, the user is provided with this \textit{near} feature in BaseX by using the above-mentioned functions as belows,
\vspace{10px}
\begin{fakeJSON}
import module namespace geo = "http://expath.org/ns/Geo";
declare namespace gml="http://www.opengis.net/gml";
let $a:= <gml:Point>
              <gml:coordinates>
               4.5,51.95 
               </gml:coordinates>
            </gml:Point>
for $b in //gml:Polygon 
return if (geo:distance( $a, $b) le 500) then $b else ()
\end{fakeJSON}
\vspace{10px}


For the data provided in a geographic coordinate system, calculations do not work with the metric values. A geographic coordinate system, such as WGS84, defines the areas and locations in a three-dimensional spherical space. Since there is not a specific unit for the current Geo Module functions, the \textit{distance} function interprets the input distance in the coordinate system of the data. For example, our sample Netherlands dataset is in a metric coordinate system. Hence,  the distance value in queries can be specified in meters. %TODO:better description

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Transform}
\caption{Having the \textit{near} feature for WGS84 data using transformation in BaseX}
\label{figTransform}
\end{figure}

The forementioned \textit{near} feature as a common use case is available in BaseX only for metric coordinate systems. To provide this feature also for geographic systems via the current geo functions, we need to convert the geographic coordinates to metric ones. In this way, we convert the specified input geometry in WGS84 to a metric system. Then, we compute the buffer of converted geometry up to the input distance in the same metric system and convert the buffer back to the original geographic coordinate system. A buffer of geometry is an identified region within a specific distance of the geometry. At the end, we find the all geometries within the buffer in geographic coorsinate system. This approach benefits from the geospatial index structure, via the \textit{within} function, while the approach with the \textit{distance} function do not utilize the geospaial index. This process is illustrated in Figure~\ref{figTransform}. 
This procedure is expressed as below, using the \textit{buffer} and \textit{within} functions and should return the same result as the previous query, 

\vspace{10px}
\begin{fakeJSON} 
within(geometry,
       transform(buffer(
                   transform(myPoint_in_wgs84, other_metric_cs)
                   , 500)
                 , wgs84
                )
      )
\end{fakeJSON}
\vspace{10px}
Having the same use cases, we have tested this feature in both databases, with the timing result shown in Figure~\ref{figBXvsMongoNear}. BaseX uses the distance function, while \textit{\$nearSphere} operator finds the geometries in MongoDB. Obviously, MongoDB has a better performance, specifically with smaller number of results. The qurey times and the number of results are directly proportional in MongoDB, since index is used and both chaneges accompany each other. BaseX do not use the geospatial index and consequently returns every results more or less in the same time.

As mentioned in Section~\ref{indexBX}, BaseX records the index structure in a file and reads it back into the main memory, when the geospatial index is required. A Point which we should contemplate is to include the time for index opening in query times, since in memory management, the index file might be removed from the memory and read back again. This time is not counted in the presented charts.
%TODO: better explanation


\subsection{Database Update}
\label{update}
%TODO:Complete!not good :|
Updating a database as a significant interaction supplied by the database system generally comprises three different operation: insert, delete, and modify. In addition to the whole issues related to the database update on disk and memory management, reconstructing the indexes is of great importance. That is, since the index is constructed based on the old database state, the updated database needs a new index. ya masal

Currently in BaseX, updating is not applied to the geospatial index after the database update operations. It means the STR-tree do not get updated automatically and the geospatial index has to be rebuilt manually. It causes redundant constructions and consequently worse performance. Here, we see how it could effect the updating performance in comparison with MongoDB which manages to rebuild the index in the updating process.

Considering the manual update of the geospatial index in BaseX, reindexing time must be examined to evaluate the updating process. This implies the index creation time plus reopeneing the index file into the main memory should be included in the evaluation. 
As shown in Figure~\ref{figBXvsMongoUpdate}, performance of all update operations in MongoDB are apparantly better. As mentioned before, reindexing in BaseX causes a huge growth in time, which individually takes the greatest amount of total time (See Figure~\ref{figBXUpdate}). We skip the result of deletion and insertion since they follow the similar pattern as update.

The unsatisfactory performance of the updating and also \textit{near} feature in BaseX lead us to a new approach to use the MongoDB index from BaseX. The strategy is explained in the next section.

%TODO this is some part that we can speak about it in Conclusion
%Since the current index implementation do not involves updating based on the STR-tree definition, hence a new index should be designed and implemented.................

\subsection{Querying by MongoDB via BaseX}
\label{MongoviaBX}
Up to this point we have investigated both BaseX and MongoDB to gain some improvement ideas for BaseX. We go further in this way by querying the data with MongoDB through BaseX. A conceivable goal for this approach could be supplying the missing features or make the features with better performance in MongoDB accessible from BaseX. In this approach, BaseX could be used as a coonector to MongoDB, then the provided queries in MongoDB syntax are executed by MongoDB and the results are shown through BaseX. For the missing feature, this would add a functionality to BaseX. But, for the common queries we should evaluate the new query times to see how the performance changes. 
The test implementation is done by defining a connection string and the intended query in a function. However, these tasks could be specified through the XQuery by user and we just have done it as a test. 
In regards to the unsatisfactory query times in the \textit{near} feature, we have tried the \textit{\$nearSphere} operator. The performance modification of this feature is demonstrated in Figure~\ref{figMongoviaBX-near}.
 
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{MongoviaBX-near-sec-log.png}
\caption{Performance comparision of the \textit{near} feature in BaseX vs. MongoDB through BaseX}
\label{figMongoviaBX-near}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{figMongoviaBX-near} implies that the performance of the \textit{near} query executed by MongoDB is preferable. The constant performance trend in BaseX is because of the no index inclusion. Hence, the user can benefit from this functionality in MongoDB through BaseX. 


\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{MongoviaBX-Update-sec-log.png}
\caption{Performance comparision of the update operation in BaseX vs. MongoDB through BaseX}
\label{figMongoviaBX-update}
\end{figure}

This process is done for the update operaions such that the update query modifies the database in MongoDB. Correspondingly, it should be decided to continue the querying either in MongoDB or in BaseX after repeating the update queries and rebuilding the index structure. Figure~\ref{figMongoviaBX-update} indicates the better timing result of updating by MongoDB through BaseX. 

\subsection{Discussion}
\label{s.disc}
Throughout this section we investigated two strategies to efficiently process the geospatial data in BaseX. Based on these investigations, here we will discuss the  previously-mentioned approaches of the geospatial processing in BaseX and cover the pros and cons of the available approaches, particularly the most recent one in Section~\ref{MongoviaBX}. 

To start with, we suppose that a user has a geospatial dataset in GML and they would like to work in this format in BaseX, since their general requirements are met by BaseX. Based on our examinations, there are some queries in which BaseX is not able to cover them or can not provide some features in a proper timing. It means those cases either are not covered, like updating the index structure or are covered with an apparently poor performance in comparision with the other similar query times, such as the \textit{near} feature. Therefore, geospatial queries such as \textit{intersects} or \textit{within}, can be applied efficiently while some other like \textit{near} and update, can not. Furthermore, regarding to our assumption, some funtionalities of BaseX convinces the user to work with GML. We call them \textit{GML-related} features. We consider these co-called \textit{GML-related} features in our discussion, as they might influnce the geospatial processing approch that wil be preferred.

%Although BaseX can handle the non-geospatial queries as well as some geospatial queries like intersects %and within almost efficiently using Index, the near query and the database update decreases the efficiency dramatically. Therefore, besides the geospatial queries there might be some non-geospatial queries as well, e.g. finding the point elements or the number of polygons in a dataset. It means the geospatial queries are not necessarily the only focuse of the queries and the user can mix both types in a piece of code. Hence, these so-called non-geospatial queries should be considered in the set of user requiremets, however analysing them are not our focuse. This point is important when the user wants to choose between BaseX and MongoDB for geospatial queries while the non-geospaial queries will be done by BaseX. In this case the user can benefi from both databases while the most requirements are fulfilled by BaseX. 

%To summarize the results of our investigations, the near query and the geospatial index updating in BaseX are far from the ......???, though geospatial query times which are the focuse of the index structure, like intersects, seem that could be satisfying in some cases/some how.???  

Table~\ref{t.comparisonBaseXMongo} summarizes the statement above. \textit{MongoDB through BaseX} in this table means BaseX connects to MongoDB to benefit by the features which are not available or available with poor performance in BaseX, as discussed in Section~\ref{MongoviaBX}. \textit{GML-related} features points the forementioned features which are supposed here to be satisfying enough for the user, indicatd with the notation $"\times"$. This assumption is made in order to concentrate on the evaluation of those cases in which the user choose to use BaseX and we try to cover the missing geospatial features.
%Otherwise, the user might choose to work with another system, like MongoDB.
% is better in efficiency.
With $"\times\times"$, we mean that option is very efficient.

\end{tabular}
\caption{The comparison of two strategies; using BaseX or connect to MongoDB via BaseX}
\label{t.comparisonBaseXMongo}
\end{table}
\vspace{10px}

As is expressed in Table~\ref{t.comparisonBaseXMongo}, the geospatial queries like \textit{intersects} and \textit{within} are working with an acceptable performance in BaseX. On the other hand, for the \textit{near} and update queries connecting to MongoDB seems to be the appropriate approach. Hence, a fast conclusion would be to have the advantage of using MongoDB through BaseX. However, the synchronization of the database instace in BaseX and the database instance in MongoDB should be precisely examined. If the user intends to modify the database which means also the modification of index without any further querying regarding the changes, the faster strategy is to update the MongoDB instace, while the database instance in BaseX remains untouched. But, in case that the user wants to do further querying based on the changes, this approach is not optimized.  

One way to discard the above-mentioned problem could be limiting the user to do all geospatial queries regarding the index in MongoDB and use BaseX just as a connector. 
However, as we see in Table~\ref{t.comparisonBaseXMongo} doing some queries in BaseX are more efficient and connecting to MongoDB might be a disadvantage, since this adds at least the connection time to the query time. Moreover, the complete dependency of BaseX on MongoDB for all geospatial queries would be too much and disadvantageous while each system is designed for different requirements and follow various goals. 
%a big limitation for this software regarding the geospatial processing. 
Thus, it will be more appropriate to provide the user with both possiblities.

Table~\ref{t.possibilities} summarizes the sample scenarios that could happen based on the existing features to process the geospatial data. In addition, this table shows the relevant/appropriate actions the user can apply as an efficient strategy toward her/his goal.


\begin{table}
\centering
\scalebox{1}{
\begin{tabular}{|l | l | }\hline
\textbf{Scenarios} & \textbf{What to do?}\\\hline
 Needs a \textit{instersects/within} query  & Using BaseX only\\
and no update and no \textit{near} query  & \\\hline
 Needs a \textit{near} query and no update & Using BaseX and MongoDB together\\\hline
 Needs modifications in the database & Using MongoDB only\\\hline
\end{tabular} }
\caption{Possible scenarios and appropriate actions suggested to take}
\label{t.possibilities}
\end{table}

The first scenario in Table~\ref{t.possibilities} is the use cases in which the BaseX \textit{Geo Module} functions and index structure fulfills all the requirements and there is no need for further queries, while the database remains unchaged. In such case, every thing could be done by BaseX. In the second scenario of this table the user needs the \textit{near} feature as a missing one, based on the untouched state of the database. For this case the user could connect to MongoDB in order to gain the result easier and faster. It should be mentioned that the issues related to the coordinate systems must be managed before applying the \textit{near} query. The last scenario mentioned in the table is the cases in shich the database will be updated and the next queries are based on the new state of the database. In this case which BaseX does not provide a proper way, accessing MongoDB update facilities and applying the subsequent queries in MongoDB hereafter is the advantageous approach. 

\subsection{Conclusion}
\label{conc}
In this section, we mainly concentrated on the geospatial features of MongoDB in order to find ways to improve the BaseX Geo Module efficiency. We started with the investigation of geospatial features to see the different viewpoints in MongoDB. Based on the common features in both databases, the perofrmances was represented and explained both with and without the index, to see the influence of geospatial index on them.
Among the queries, finding the geometries within a specific distance, called the \textit{near} feature, is of a great importance, as it is widely used. MongoDB provides this feature in both WGS84 for the data on the Earth as well as legacy cordinate pairs, while BaseX supports only for the projected coordinate systems, since geospatial functions in BaseX do the calculation on the flat space. To add the support of data in WGS84 in BaseX, new functions should be implemented. Testing this feature in both databases shows better performance in MongoDB. 

%through \textit{\$near} and \textit{\$nearSphere} operators in MongoDB, while BaseX. 
Besides, updating in both databases is discussed. Update in MongoDB implicitly updates the index structure, while the geospatial index in BaseX must be reconstructed. Therefore, query time severly increases considering the time consumed by index updating. 


Since the performance of two major functionalities, i.e., the \textit{near} feature and updating, are not satisfying in BaseX and MongoDB provides them in a faster way, we connect to MongoDB and run these queries through BaseX. The results of the \textit{near} feature by this approach seem convincing enough to have this alternative way of querying in BaseX. In addition, updating the database by MongoDB via BaseX is faster than updating in BaseX. However, using this approach is controversial. The discussion is in regards to the subsequent queries after the database modification. Indeed, the changes happen in MongoDB and the database in BaseX remains untouched. Therefore, further querying based on the new changes is possible merely in MongoDB. In case that the next geospatial queries need to be done in BaseX, this way will not worth trying, because the whole update and index reconstruction process must be repeated in BaseX. The approach sets the limitation for the use cases in which the database will be updated, to do the geospatial querying completely in MongoDB.
